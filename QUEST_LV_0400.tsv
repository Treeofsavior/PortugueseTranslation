QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000001	Kedoran Alliance Merchant Alta
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000002	I came here since I was worried, but I won't dare to go in there by myself.{nl}That's why I am asking you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000003	I can't just wonder into places like that you know.{nl}There are monsters just sitting there...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000004	There's rumors of the Alembique Legend among the refugees.{nl}I wanted to know the truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000005	{nl}There might be products that the Alliance is looking for...{nl}Since you were going to explore the cave anyways, it's like hitting two Popolions with one stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000006	{nl}I'll give you this book as payment.{nl}It'll be better than going in blind will it not?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000007	Priest Lintas is correcting the contents of the monument.{nl}The process is taking some time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000008	Thanks to you, the monument has been corrected.{nl}We need to check up on the status of Priest Kidas and Brunas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000009	Even with the help, a flechette is nowhere to be found.{nl}I should go back to my master after sorting things out a bit in here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000010	Aquilas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000011	I came here to learn archery but am just running errands finding that blasted arrow...{nl}If I knew that I had to look for arrows. I would not have started this journey...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000012	I mean, this is all because of Lydia Schaffen.{nl}She should have taken her Flechette or whatever if she had used it to kill Ghibulinas!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000013	{nl}Who cares if she is a legendary person.{nl}She doesn't know how to look after her things.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000014	{nl}I can't understand my master.{nl}I don't know how I can be forgiven if I find that Flechette or whatever.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000015	{nl}Even if I do somehow agree that it is important... I don't get how reporting on the vegetation is supposed to be important.{nl}Ugh... Not my kind of work.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000016	I'd be really grateful if you'd offer any type of help.{nl}First of all, could you get me some Poppy Bracken, Aily Grass and Pria Flowers.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000017	{nl}What do they have to do with the legendary arrow?{nl}I have no idea either.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000018	Stupid Flechette or whatever it's called...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000019	Mechen
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000020	I thought that Aquilas had come to report...{nl}This place is dangerous due to all of the monsters and demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000021	{nl}How about leaving if you don't have any important business.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000022	{nl}Oh?{nl}Ah, you're a Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000023	{nl}It seems as if you are curious as to what my apprentices and I are doing here.{nl}Have you heard anything from Aquilas?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000024	{nl}Oh, I am a member of the Astral Tower and sibling to the former leader.{nl}I made a big mistake while Ignas was trying to take control of the Astral Tower.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000025	{nl}Ignas didn't miss out on the opportunity and took over the Astral Tower.{nl}Of course, the rest of the members don't look upon me so kindly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000026	{nl}No matter how I tell them that it was a mistake, they refuse to listen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000027	{nl}That's why I have decided to try and find Lydia Schaffen's Flechette to try and undo my wrongdoings.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000028	{nl}They'll at least pretend to listen if I bring back the Flechette.{nl}I've come to this place as I am almost certain that her Flechette must be in Ghibulinas Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000029	{nl}My apprentices and I have been trying to look for the Flechette but there's been no progress.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000030	I see you've gathered it all.{nl}Thanks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000031	{nl}Go to the camp and ask my master if you're wondering why we had to do this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000032	{nl}Well, I'd better start looking at these unremarkable things to find something different.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000033	Hmm... I thank you for your eagerness, but this place is much too dangerous with all of the demons roaming around. {nl}I would appreciate it if you would simply ask my apprentices how they are doing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000034	{nl}Woognis is at the Vilkas Nest, Jenonhas is at Kainen Crossing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000035	Whoa, you scared me! Who are you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000036	{nl}The current situation?{nl}I haven't even gone anywhere near the area since I'm too afraid.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000037	{nl}That over there is the Vilkas nest, but how am I supposed to get in there.{nl}I don't know, maybe I'll be able to get there if I cover myself with Vilkas fur...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000038	We'll be put in danger if we go and fight Vilkas near their nest.{nl}There are a lot of Vilkas at Kyrba Lot as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000039	{nl}Why don't we try gathering Vilkas fur over there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000040	There's a lot of Vilkas at Kyrba Lot, so it should be easy enough to get their fur there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000041	I think we'll be able to fool them into thinking we're one of their friends with this amount of fur.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000042	I'm thinking of going to search their nest with this fur all over me.{nl}It's quite large so I don't know how long it will take but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000043	There's no reason for me to decline your offer of help.{nl}Let's go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000044	There doesn't seem to be a Flechette where I checked.{nl}Did you find anything?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000045	{nl}Ah yes...{nl}Nothing...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000046	So my search has resulted in nothing.{nl}You said that you were gathering reports?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000047	{nl}There are two other apprentices.{nl}One is Aquilas and the other is Jenonhas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000048	{nl}Aquilas is on the road to Phamer Forest and Jenonhas is at Kainen Crossing.{nl}You said that you've already met Aquilas, so try looking for Jenonhas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000049	I'll return after wrapping things up here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000050	Jenonhas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000051	Thank you so much.{nl}I wouldn't have made it if you hadn't come here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000052	Yes, that is correct.{nl}I am looking for the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000053	{nl}If it was something that could have been found so easily, people would have already taken it, don't you think?{nl}This is pointless.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000054	{nl}There are even demons here.{nl}I can't understand my orders this time round.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000055	{nl}I'm going to have to talk about this later.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000056	Everyone is exhausted since they're searching for an arrow that seems to be non-existant.{nl}Especially where there are so many demons roaming around...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000057	{nl}It's all because I am not skilled enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000058	The first Fletcher Master crafted the Flechette for Lydia Schaffen.{nl}Of course I thought about asking the Fletcher Master.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000059	{nl}But the Fletcher Master and the other members of the Astral Tower... They won't talk to me because they think I am a traitor.{nl}That's why I am not even thinking about it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000060	Of course I would appreciate the help but...{nl}I'm sure that it won't make a difference.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000061	{nl}Don't be too disappointed though.{nl}The Fletcher Master is at the Goddess' Ancient Garden.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000062	Fletcher Master
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000063	You said that Mechen asked you to find the Flechette?{nl}You still came to me knowing what kind of person he is correct?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000064	{nl}Of course I might think of helping him if he agrees to return the Flechette after finding it.{nl}However, he'll show his true colors as soon as we find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000065	If you say that, I'll agree to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000066	{nl}This is a recipe for detecting the Flechette.{nl}Take this to Mechen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000067	The Goddess' Ancient Garden...{nl}It will be a long trip.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000068	He gave you a recipe that will allow us to craft equipment that will help us detect the Flechette?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000069	{nl}How did he decide to help us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000070	{nl}Ah... 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000071	{nl}I see.{nl}He agreed to help us under the condition of having my life if I do not give the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000072	{nl}I don't think that will be necessary.{nl}I'll take a look at this recipe then...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000073	Mechen is the person who allowed the previous leader for the Astral Tower, his brother, to be taken down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000074	{nl}How can I trust such a person.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000075	The Flechette is said to be crafted from the divine energy of the Goddess.{nl}It says that we have to get the energy of a powerful demon since it will react to their energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000076	I'm worried that he might make us go and find capture a demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000077	You've collected a lot.{nl}Now what we need is...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000078	The recipe says that we need Vilkas essence in order to control the demon's energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000079	My apprentices have gone to different locations to gather Vilkas essence.{nl}Could you please go to Kyrba Lot?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000080	All you have to do is gather Vilkas essence from Kyrba Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000081	We have gathered all of the materials needed to create the detector.{nl}I'll start crafting it then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000082	I've finished crafting the detector.{nl}I'm going to give it to my apprentices to try and find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000083	{nl}I guess it will make it easier to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000084	If you wish to participate in finding the Flechette, please start at Taylie Lot.{nl}The other places will be covered by my apprentices.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000085	{nl}Try using the detector at Taylie Lot at places you think the Flechette might be.{nl}It will react if the Flechette is nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000086	Go to Taylie Lot and look for the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000087	Ah, have you found the Flechette?{nl}It feels a bit abrupt after all that fruitless time we spent searching for it...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000088	{nl}Of course, none of us are Revelators...{nl}Good job.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000089	{nl}Now it's time to take the Flechette to the Fletcher Master.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000090	Please be careful.{nl}I wish that this would help resolve the misunderstanding between us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000091	This... it is the Flechette that was created by my elders.{nl}I didn't think that Mechen would give it this easily.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000092	{nl}Hmm...{nl}Take this.{nl}Tell him that this is a sort of reward for finding me the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000093	{nl}I don't know how much good it will do for his honor...{nl}But people will at least know how much he went through to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000094	A promise is a promise, so I'll hand it over.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000095	This... it's an Arrow of Proof crafted by the Fletcher Master...{nl}I hope people will listen to me a bit more if I have this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000096	This will help Mechen recover some of his honor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000097	Hello there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000098	{nl}We are apprentices of Maven.{nl}We are rewriting the misinformation that has been spread about the Ruklys incident on this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000099	{nl}These were almost destroyed because of the actions for King Kadumel.{nl}However, King Barynwell decided to cast magic on them to make them unreadable instead.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000100	{nl}We are preparing to undo the magic and make the corrections.{nl}The monsters are stopping us from doing anything though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000101	We will gladly accept any help you can offer us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000102	{nl}First of all, we need to find the documents.{nl}These documents contain instructions on how to dispell transfiguration magic, but they've been scattered due to monster attacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000103	{nl}We were careful in making any further moves since we don't want to provoke any more monster attacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000104	{nl}Please try looking at Othorove Lot first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000105	We need those documents to dispell the magic and correct the information on this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000106	I see that they've all been scattered like this.{nl}Thank you for gathering all of the pages.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000107	{nl}Now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000108	We'll have to find an orb in order to dispell the magic.{nl}The orb will quickly be depleted so we also had a recharging orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000109	The orb will absorb the energy from the recharging orb.{nl}Therefore, you should be able to find where the orb is if you carry this around with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000110	The recharging orb will emmit magic when activated.{nl}The magic will go towards the orb since it will try to absorb it and will glow when it does so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000111	{nl}All you have to do is to find the orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000112	Magic will come out of the recharging orb when it is activated.{nl}You'll be able to find the orb if you follow it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000113	Oh, thank you so much!{nl}Now that we have the orbs...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000114	We have finished all of the preparations required to dispel the magic on King Kadumel's Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000115	You've dealt with the Gosal?{nl}I can't believe that you took that thing on single handed when the three of us...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000116	{nl}You don't seem to be just another traveler for some reason...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000117	Whatever the case may be, the Gosal is gone, so we'll be able to go there.{nl}We'll have to check Tarkha Lot to see what the object is.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000118	This thing that looks like a tree is actually an monument.{nl}This is all because of the spell.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000119	{nl}We'll dispell it with the orb you've recovered for us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000120	The monument has now returned to it's original shape.{nl}We'll now find any pieces of misinformation and correct them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000121	We've finished correcting this one, so we'll have to search for other monuments.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000122	{nl}Please, follow me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000123	Here it is.{nl}I will dispell the magic that is cast on the monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000124	I think that the spores from this bracken have caused the paralysis.{nl}I can't dispell the magic in this state.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000125	{nl}We'll have to wait for me to be able to move again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000126	{nl}You can find Mittelly Herbs near Ausne Lot.{nl}Mittelly Herbs are known to cure such issues.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000127	There should be plenty of Mittelly Herbs near Ausne Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000128	{nl}I'm sorry for being so dependant when you simply volunteered to help...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000129	There are people that have started to deny the existance of the Goddesses after they have all disappeared.{nl}I want to help them believe once more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000130	{nl}However...{nl}I lost my faith in people... as well as the Seed...{nl}{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000131	At this rate...{nl}I am afraid that I might lose all faith in humanity...{nl}Not a good thing for a priest...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000132	Ah, that feels much better.{nl}I don't think it has completely healed me, but it is enough to allow me to dispell the magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000133	All Vaivora's Koru is able to tell us is that Goddess Ausrine is in a mysterious place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000134	What do you think that the mysterious place will look like?{nl}We have more questions than answers...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000135	Goddess Lada is said to be at Seir Rainforest.{nl}The closest place is most likely Arcus Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000136	I suppose I'll be able to meet her if I go to Seir Rainforest?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000137	Will you be so kind as to remove the bracken from the Monument?{nl}I'll be paralyzed once more if you don't do so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000138	{nl}I doubt it will burn because of all the humidity in this area.{nl}Maybe using the dry skin of the Vilkas would be enough to light a proper fire.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000139	If the plague rears it's ugly head once more the people of Kiren Province won't stand a chance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000140	I never even imagined that there would be bracken with paralyzing spores.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000141	{nl}However... I can't imagine that you are just a simple traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000142	I see that all the bracken has burned.{nl}I'll dispell the magic on the Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000143	Hmm... I've checked the Monument, but it seems as if this one doesn't need to be corrected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000144	Ah, you have gathered quite a lot.{nl}I'm sure that they'll burn nicely even in this humidity.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000145	The paralysis doesn't seem to be getting any better.{nl}What should I do...?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000146	Thank you so much.{nl}I'll give you the detector that had allowed me to find the Monuments.{nl}All you need to do is to use it near an object you think might be a Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000147	Use the detector near anything you think might be a Monument.{nl}The detector will let you know it's a Monument by creating a circle around it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000148	You've found a Monument.{nl}I think I am well enough to move now, so let's head over there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000149	I've dispelled the magic and checked what is written on the Monument.{nl}However, it is hard to see what is on it since it has been badly damaged.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000150	There might be fragments nearby.{nl}Could you please check the surrounding area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000151	There should be fragments from the Monument nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000152	Ah, I see that you've collected quite a few fragments.{nl}Let me check those.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000153	I've checked all of the fragments you brought back.{nl}There's a few that have misinformation on them, so please give me a second to correct them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000154	Priest Kidas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000155	Have you come all this way to help?{nl}May you be blessed by the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000156	{nl}Checking the contents of this Monument will be difficult.{nl}As you can see, there are too many vines surrounding it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000157	{nl}Brunas and myself were trying to get rid of the vegetation here, but we couldn't find any useful materials.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000158	{nl}We'd like to use Vilkas salivary glands since they have strong abrasive properties, but getting them is a problem since they won't just give them to us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000159	Getting them to give us the salivary glands is quite hard...{nl}We'll have to wait for them to become weak after attacking them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000160	{nl}You will have to feed them Mytiharyn Grass when they're weakened. This will make them salivate abrasive saliva.{nl}You will have to finish them off now and get the salivary glands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000161	Of course, they might attack you and resist eating the Mytiharyn Grass, so please be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000162	The salivary glands you brought should be enough.{nl}However...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000163	We need water to dilute the poison from the salivary glands you brought.{nl}Brunas went to Putas Lot to get the water, but hasn't come back for a while...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000164	I hope everything is okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000165	Priest Brunas
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000166	Thank you. You saved my life.{nl}Ah, you've collected all of the salivary glands needed?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000167	{nl}We'll be able to get rid of the vegetation once I take this water there then.{nl}I'll hurry back to Kidas then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000168	I've heard that you helped Kidas and Brunas a lot.{nl}Thank you for allowing us to finish our work. It had been stalled for a long time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000169	{nl}I knew I was right in thinking you're not just a normal traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000170	{nl}Whomever you may really be, may you be blessed by the Goddesses.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000171	We are planning on publishing a book with the corrections made to these Monuments in order to allow more people to know about the truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000172	{nl}Please make sure to take a look at the book if you have a chance to do so.{nl}Thank you for all the helped you gave us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000173	This is an area where a plague that caused fevers in people before leading them to their death.{nl}It's a bit quiet at the moment, but we don't know when it'll become worse again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000174	{nl}I'm in the middle of researching that plague.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000175	I might die before I get anywhere near completing a cure if you don't help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000176	I am going to send the cure to the Plague Doctor Master when it is complete.{nl}I will try strengthening it just in case.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000177	Go and see how Woognis is doing at the Vilkas Nest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000178	Something must have happened to Priest Lintas who was dispelling the magic from the monument. Approach him to see what is wrong.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000179	Kidas has removed the vegetation from the Monument and is taking a closer look.{nl}It seems to be taking much longer than expected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000180	You've come back.{nl}I heard that you saved Brunas from monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000181	{nl}I thank you for helping us gather all of the ingredients and saving Brunas.{nl}We finished diluting the poison while you were coming back.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000182	{nl}We'll correct any misinformation on the Monument after removing the vegetation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000183	There was misinformation on the Monument, so we corrected it.{nl}We're going to go back and report to Lintas about our success here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000184	{nl}Thank you for helping us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000185	I am grateful to all of my apprentices who followed me all the way here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000186	I feel sorry that I haven't been able to teach them properly because of my mistakes and poor decisions.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000187	I followed him to learn archery, not about shrubs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000188	Here I am ripping weeds out instead of at the archery range.{nl}I am seriously considering just going back home.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000189	I told him that I don't want to pick at weeds anymore and he told me to wait here.{nl}I hope he won't tell me to go and gather leaves next.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000190	I feel like I'll forget how to lose how to hold a bow.{nl}I should go and ask him to teach me archery instead of how to get rid of weeds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000191	I always picked on Jenonhas because of his direct way of communication.{nl}It seems like that we won't have to pick any more weeds thanks to him though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000192	They say that a person called Ignas became the leader of the Astral Tower because of a mistake he made.{nl}What sort of mistake gets the leader of the Astral Tower changed?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000193	We followed him because we wished to learn archery.{nl}However, all he is doing is trying to find the Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000194	It is pretty much impossible to find an arrow in this large area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000195	Jenonhas and Aquilas have a lot of resentment at the moment.{nl}Of course, Aquilas would rather keep his complaints under wraps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000196	Jenonhas on the other hand, is much more direct and forthcoming.{nl}I'm actually sort of amazed that he didn't say anything up to this point.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000197	Jenonhas and Aquilas are as tired out as I am with this fruitless search.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000198	There was a time when I asked him about what mistake he made to buy the wrath of the Astral Tower members.{nl}He didn't answer me at the time and looked into the distance while sighing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000199	It is said that Lydia Schaffen had defeated the Demon King Ghibulinas in this forest with the Flechette.{nl}However, Lydia Schaffen hadn't retrieved that fantastic arrow after that feat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000200	{nl}Why didn't Lydia Schaffen retrieve her arrow?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000201	I tried my best to find the Flechette thinking that it would help him recover his honor.{nl}However, I was threatened by monsters and demons the whole time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000202	{nl}I thought that I might lose my life while trying to regain his honor.{nl}That's why I went to talk about the current situation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000203	{nl}I don't care if this will reflect poorly on me.{nl}It is better than watching my colleagues die trying to find an arrow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000204	I don't understand the Astral Tower's reaction to him either.{nl}Of course, I don't know what his mistake was but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000205	{nl}They are said to have gone through a lot together...{nl}I think that the members of the Astral Tower should forgive him now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000206	How sad do you think a Master would be if one of his apprentices lost their honor.{nl}Maven must have been extremely sad watching on as Ruklys lost his honor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000207	I am going to continue Maven's work by letting the people know the truth about Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000208	I will correct the misunderstandings that have been plaguing the Kingdom since King Kadumel's time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000209	This must be done no matter how hard it is to make people take another look at Ruklys.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000210	Rewriting the history regarding Ruklys is needed in order to correct the misinformation that is included in our history.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000211	Kidas and myself would have done our part once we check and correct this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000212	We will correct the misinformation about Ruklys by correcting this Monument.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000213	Ohla
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000214	Hello there!{nl}Have you seen my daughter by any chance?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000215	{nl}She has twin-tails and is wearing a hood.{nl}Her name's Liel.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000216	{nl}She disappeared without saying anything...{nl}I thought she had gone to a friend's house and checked there but there was no trace of her there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000217	{nl}I think she may have gone out of the Refugee Camp.{nl}I've tried asking people to help, but nobody seem to be willing to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000218	{nl}I know that it's asking a lot with the monsters threatening everyone but...{nl}I've come out since I was so worried but there doesn't seem to be anything I can do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000219	If there was anywhere I thought she might be, I would have gone there already...{nl}I guess we should try looking for places nearby.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000220	{nl}Could you please try looking at Preivhengikas Felled Area?{nl}Where could she have gone with all of these monsters crawling around...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000221	She's my only daughter and family since I lost my husband during Medzio Diena.{nl}She's all I have in this world now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000222	{nl}Please, find Liel for me...{nl}Please...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000223	I don't know what my mother is thinking...{nl}Not even knowing that I left to get her some wool so she won't catch any more colds...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000224	{nl}The fact that I couldn't do anything for her and that she had to go to...{nl}I am so sorry...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000225	Thank the Goddess...{nl}I already don't know how to repay you for saving my daughter...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000226	{nl}But you're offering to even get the wool...{nl}I don't know how I am to repay you for your generousity...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000227	There's an insect called the White Tree Forest Moth...{nl}It's cacoons are known to be around here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000228	{nl}Liel used to go and gather them to use as silk.{nl}I don't know where she hears these things...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000229	{nl}I know she's my daughter, but isn't she resourceful?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000230	I'm just sorry that I can't offer her more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000231	We're searching this area for a Flechette.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000232	I think that this should be enough to stitch the tent back up.{nl}Thank you so much for helping me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000233	Curtis
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000234	Ah, you must be the person who saved that girl, Liel.{nl}The way you simply dealed with the monsters that several young men weren't able to tackle...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000235	{nl}Ah, look at me... I've forgetten to introduce myself.{nl}My name's Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000236	{nl}I'm just another refugee who lost his family and home during Medzio Diena and is trying to get by.{nl}I don't think that coming here helped matters at all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000237	{nl}It's difficult getting things that are needed for basic survival.{nl}That means there are more conflicts between the refugees as well as theives...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000238	{nl}We've tried to make some rules and set up defences against the monsters that keep attacking us but...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000239	We were in dire need of help.{nl}If you're capable of saving Liel, I'm sure you're more than able to help us a bit more!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000240	{nl}I know we might seem a tad ungrateful, but please...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000241	{nl}There are many who haven't had a proper meal for a long time.{nl}We've lost the farmland that we took so much care of...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000242	{nl}We need something to settle that hunger more than anything.{nl}Could you please get us some Flowlevi head flower?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000243	{nl}When dried the seeds come out.{nl}We can cook them
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000244	The monsters in this area are a bit more fierce since they are all starving.{nl}Please don't try to bite off more than you can chew and just run if you think it's a bit too much.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000245	Many people will have full stomaches today thanks to the food you've brought back.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000246	Monsters have been attacking us much more frequently.{nl}That's why we've put up those walls and distributed any weapons we could find to the young men.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000247	{nl}The walls keep the monsters at bay, but we're worried that they aren't strong enough.{nl}They seem to break whenever monsters decide to start rampaging.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000248	{nl}We're repairing them with wood each time.{nl}What I'm saying is that we use a lot of wood just repairing the walls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000249	Go to Saughus Lot with the tools I gave you.{nl}You'll be able to get a lot of good materials there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000250	{nl}After gathering some wood there, you'll be able to make some repair kits for the walls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000251	The problem was that the walls were weak since nobody had any knowledge on how to make them.{nl}They break down every time monsters decide to attack us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000252	{nl}That's why we have to keep repairing them every day.{nl}Of course that means we need a lot of wood as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000253	This should be enough for one repair session.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000254	I'll distribute the wood you've gathered to allow the repairs to start.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000255	I know we've asked a lot, but please...{nl}All you need to do is to repair the wall in front of you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000256	The rest will be repaired by the other people.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000257	We could have scraped by and repaired the walls but...{nl}I had no idea that you would help us so generously.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000258	Michekan Forest is extremely cold at night.{nl}You'll catch frostbites if you don't wrap up tightly enough at night.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000259	{nl}That's why we need a lot of clothes or covers that use Flowlon leathers.{nl}Of course it isn't easy for us to deal with the monsters in the first place...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000260	This place is cold enough at night to make you shiver non-stop.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000261	I think this will be enough for all the people here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000262	The worst part of this place is the lack of water.{nl}We did manage to set up a few wells here and there...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000263	{nl}We haven't been able to drink it after the poison from the White Trees managed to trickle into the water supply.{nl}We've had to purify the water in one way or another.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000264	{nl}We are using a grass called Randulin.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000265	I'll give you a bottle of water.{nl}The problem is that Randulin usually is well hidden beneath the earth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000266	{nl}However, it will turn yellow when touched by the un-purified water here.{nl}You'll be able to see where the Randulin is by sprinkling the ground with this water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000267	A lot of people suffered greatly when we didn't know about the issues with the water.{nl}Aurlelse who is good with herbs, taught people how to purify the water.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000268	Yes.{nl}What you have brought is indeed Randulin.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000269	{nl}I think that will allow us to drink purified water for quite some time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000270	Did I tell you about the farmland that we had worked on?{nl}We had used the cable-car here in order to create arable land over at Lacetti Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000271	{nl}Even if it's a bit far from here, there's a lot of sunlight as well as soft soil.{nl}But we always had to be prepared to fix the old and worn cable-car since it was the only way for use to get there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000272	{nl}That's why we prepared tools to fix it at a moments notice in a pouch and place it somewhere we could find easily.{nl}The monsters mistook them for food bags and stole them all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000273	Monsters must have been starving too.{nl}Taking something they cannot eat...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000274	Ah, yes.{nl}Those are the pouches.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000275	There's still a problem left even if we are able to repair the cable-car again.{nl}As soon as we tilled the soil at Phavegheliai, monsters started attacking us there as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000276	{nl}This is a matter of our survival.{nl}People will start starving if monsters are allowed to control that land for too long.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000277	{nl}That's why I'm gathering young men to go and drive them off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000278	I knew that it wouldn't be something that a handful of people could accomplish...{nl}I believe that you'll manage to tip things in our favor even more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000279	Phavegheliai Farm will be on the other end of the cable-car that you get on at Lacetti Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000280	Liel...Are you there Liel?{nl}Where could she have gone to...{nl}I told her to not go out of the Refugee Camp...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000281	If you see a girl with a hood that has twin-tails, please bring her here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000282	I'm looking for a girl with a hood and twin-tails.{nl}Her name is Liel. Have you seen her?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000283	If you do find her, please bring her back to me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000284	Phavegheliai Farm was nothing but grasslands.{nl}It seemed perfect since there wasn't too many monsters and the sunlight was good here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000285	{nl}That's why we started to farm here and the crops made it well.{nl}Then, the monsters came after the crops and we lost control of the farm.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000286	It seems like we'll be able to farm again thanks to you.{nl}I suppose it would be too much to ask you to stay with us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000287	{nl}Why don't you meet the people before you leave...{nl}I'm sure they'll have plenty to say to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000288	You've listened to all of the worries of the people here?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000289	{nl}I'm sure there wasn't one story that wasn't heartbreaking.{nl}Some feel like life here is nothing but trouble.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000290	{nl}Some people say that I don't know about the severity of this situation, but I assure you that I do.{nl}This type of life will not be sustainable without material help from someone else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000291	{nl}I am sorry for the children as they will not be able to see the outside world.{nl}I have of course considered moving somehwere else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000292	{nl}However, we don't know exactly where we are in the Great Woodlands so we can't simply pick a direction either.{nl}We don't have enough food or supplies and the monsters are a never ending threat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000293	Really?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000294	{nl}Thank you.{nl}We would appreciate it if you could go to a major city for help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000295	I see that there are refugees that haven't been able to receive proper assistance.{nl}I shall ask the lords near Michekan if they can't offer some help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000296	How did it go?{nl}Is there a city willing to help us?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000297	The Knight Commander at Klaipeda said that he'd request help from the other lords?{nl}That's just what I wanted to hear.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000298	{nl}Thank you so much for going the extra bit for us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000299	I shall ask the lords near Michekan Forest to aid the refugees.{nl}I'll try to make them hurry a bit as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000300	Aurlelse
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000301	I think of the peaceful days before Medzio Diena every day.{nl}The Potato Dumplings I used to have with my wife were the best...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000302	I lost my wife to a large branch that crashed on top of the house that day.{nl}I am regretful that I wasn't even able to properly bury her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000303	Alex
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000304	I am also afraid that I'll be attacked like Mr. Curtis.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000305	{nl}He was attacked by monsters a while ago when trying to drive them out of town.{nl}I can still see him in pain because of the wounds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000306	If it wasn't for Medzio Diena, I would have married my love and be living a happy life...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000307	Wickens
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000308	It wasn't too long after I came here.{nl}Waltas was stealing for his wife and baby.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000468	The Cave of Legends : Revised Edition Volume 1
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000469	There have been many tales{nl}of mysterious locations{nl}long before written history.{nl}This book contains three{nl}of those wonderous locations.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000470	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will start with the legends of Alembique.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000471	Chapter 1 Legends of Alembique{nl}-{nl}There are tales of a cave named Alembique{nl}in the southern province of Kiren.{nl}{nl}It is said that a brilliant alchemist{nl}created many invaluable goods{nl}and occasionally invited people{nl}to show off to them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000472	Nobody seems to know the location{nl}of the mysterious Alembique Cave.{nl}{nl}However, older people in several villages{nl}tell their descendants of being invited to the cave,{nl}and not wanting to leave the place{nl}as they had experienced never before seen luxuries.{nl}{nl}Therefore, people from these villages{nl}have a habit of congratulating any people that have gone missing{nl}and hope that they will also be invited one day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000473	The Cave of Legends : Revised Edition Volume 2
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000474	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will now go on to the hidden Royal Mausoleum.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000475	Chapter 2 : Legends of the Hidden Royal Mausoleum{nl}-{nl}The Great Woodlands have been used by the nobles and public alike{nl}as hunting grounds or refuge thanks to their lush vegetation.{nl}As such, it is an inevitability that people have experience.{nl}However, the funny thing is{nl}there is no account related to the royal family.{nl}According to some rumors,{nl}the reason for lack of accounts is because after Taniel II era.{nl}Many offerings were buried in the secret mausoleum.
	
{nl}그런데 이상하게도 왕실과 관련된{nl}이야기는 없는데 그 이유가{nl}타니엘 2세 시대에 이곳에{nl}비밀 왕릉을 만든 후 엄청난{nl}부장품을 함께 묻었기 때문이라는{nl}소문이 있습니다.	
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000476	What I am saying is that{nl}the Royalty seemed to leave this place alone{nl}as there was a secret place here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000477	To be frank, record of Taniel the Second's funeral{nl}are extremely sparse{nl}which lends extra credibility to these claims.{nl}That is because the other funerals{nl}had some sort of records{nl}no matter how small.{nl}However, even if these claims are true{nl}the Mausoleum will never see the light of day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000478	The location of the secret mausoleum remains hidden{nl}for it is almost impossible to avoid{nl}the gaze of  Goddess Medeina.{nl}That is why even if the rumors are true, it is likely that it will remain just a legend.
	
아무리 깊은 숲속에서 몰래{nl}왕릉의 위치를 캐고 다니고 싶어도{nl}대삼림지대를 돌보시는 {nl}메데이나 여신의눈을{nl}피하기는 어렵기 때문입니다.{nl}그러므로 이 소문은 설령{nl}사실이라도 영원히 전설로만{nl}남을 것 같습니다.	
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000479	The Cave of Legends : Revised Edition Volume 3
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000480	The reasoning behind selecting{nl}the particular locations is as follows.{nl}{nl}The masses are only a little less interested{nl}about riches such as treasure and gold{nl}than they are about the Goddesses.{nl}{nl}We will continue with the legends of the Golden Veins of Barconsi.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000481	Chapter 3 : The Golden Veins of Barconsi{nl}-{nl}There are tales that there is a legendary gold vein{nl}in the rural mountains of the Kingdom.{nl}It is said that a demon had found this vein{nl}and a hero defeated the demon before claiming it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000482	It is also said that the hero{nl}only took the vein to prevent the demon from using it{nl}and had no interest in using it for himself.{nl}That is why he buried the location forever.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000483	The hero eventually passed away from old age{nl}and left no children leaving the gold{nl}up for anyone to take if they could find it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000484	However, there is something suspicious{nl}about this legend.{nl}There is no record of Barconsi,{nl}the hero who supposedly took the gold from the demon{nl}in any of the Kingdom's records.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000485	As such, many people believe that{nl}this legend is fictional{nl}as there is no record of Barconsi.{nl}However, they do not try to explain{nl}why Barconsi's name is involved.{nl}Of course, there are also many people{nl}that keep searching for the gold.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000486	Refugee Brandon
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000487	I should have listened when everyone was telling me off!{nl}This forest is dangerous!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000488	I don't understand why that hunter would want to keep this forest for himself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000489	Umm, could you help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000490	{nl}I barely managed to get out of a trap, but I hurt my leg and can't go any further.{nl}Please help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000491	There's some Whitetailed Grass at Turas Lot... They say it will relieve pain.{nl}I think I'll manage to walk if I'm chewing on that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000492	There should be some in the surrounding area.{nl}Could you get some for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000493	Thank you so much.{nl}I'm going to get out of here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000494	{nl}There seems to be a violent hunter that wants to claim this land as his own.{nl}I doubted that until I got caught in one of his traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000495	{nl}From what I've heard, he's known to have tamed a beast in order to chase people off...{nl}You should avoid getting any deeper into the forest as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000496	I thought you were simply a nosy adventurer, but you seem to be a cut above the rest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000497	Let me introduce myself.{nl}My name is Vilhelmas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000498	{nl}I used to be a member... Actually, let's forget about the past since it's not important.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000499	{nl}Emmet Forest has only been recently discovered.{nl}It seems like a good place for refugees, so I was getting rid of the troublesome monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000500	{nl}There's also a beast here...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000501	{nl}You know, the rumors are mostly true... Apart from those about me of course.{nl}I am on my way to get rid of that beast.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000502	I appreciate the thought but... I'll have to see your skill before I'll allow it.{nl}I don't want there to be your blood on my hands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000503	Their saying that I tamed the beast to chase people off?{nl}That's really disheartening...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000504	I never thought you would be a Revelator...{nl}Maybe the fact that you came here was also a plan of a Goddess or two.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000505	I thought that you were skilled, but never thought that you were a Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000506	As I told you before, this is a good place for people to live.{nl}This means that this is a good place for the refugees from the Old Capital.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000507	{nl}First of all, the Kugheri must be removed in order for people to settle here.{nl}But we'll have to deal with the beast before we can tackle the Kugheri.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000508	{nl}I was getting tired of tracking him because of the curse anyways.{nl}I'd appreciate it if you could help me a bit...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000509	{nl}Of course, the beast is more than capable, which means that there will be casualties if you're not strong enough.{nl}Would you mind if I test your skills?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000510	It wasn't long after I started dealing with the Kugheri.{nl}One of the demons came crashing through Emmet Forest.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000511	{nl}I don't care what a demon would come here for.{nl}I simply took care of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000512	{nl}It was relatively easy defeating it.{nl}But there were complications.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000513	{nl}He cursed me when he was cornered.{nl}My sight is severely hindered due to that stupid curse.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000514	{nl}Anyways, he put a red gem through himself after that.{nl}He started to transform after that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000515	{nl}I'm sure you might have guessed from listening up to this point, but the beast is the demon.{nl}I realized at once that the demon was much more dangerous than before.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000516	{nl}Of course, he had a bit of fear left for me and ran as well.{nl}The long and boring fight between the two of us has been dragging on ever since then.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000517	{nl}Tracking that thing with this curse wasn't easy.{nl}Having limited vision as a hunter is  almost a death sentance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000518	{nl}I put up warnings to ward people away but refugees kept coming in despite of my efforts.{nl}I think I'll be able to settle this fight once and for all with your help though.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000519	{nl}Please, lend me your strength.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000520	Very good.{nl}Try dealing with the Kugheri of this forest.{nl}If you are able to deal with them, you might be good enough to take on the beast with me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000521	Please prove your skills by dealing with the Kugheri.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000522	Hmm... You are definitely skilled.{nl}I think I'll be able to defeat the beast if I fight with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000523	{nl}You're a bit too good...{nl}You're not just the average traveler are you? What are you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000524	So you're the...!{nl}Now I understand your skill.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000525	{nl}Well then Revelator, you should help me out with a problem I have here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000526	I think we'll give that idea a try since I have someone to help me now.{nl}I think we'll be able to critically injure the beast.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000527	{nl}The plan is to plant a trap where he normally travels and then for me to hit the beast with a poison arrow.{nl}I'll have to gather ingredients for the poison, but I can't do this alone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000528	{nl}The first ingredient for the poison can be taken from the Kugheri.{nl}I can't see them until I get near them, but they run if I get too close.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000529	{nl}Could you gather the ingredients for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000530	Thank you.{nl}You'll be able to get the poison from Kugheri Tots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000531	{nl}They seem to have poison for protection purposes when they're young, but simply taking that poison won't be enough.{nl}The poison will become much more potent if you spray them with this stimulant.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000532	{nl}Defeat them and bring me the enhanced poison sacks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000533	Approach the Kugheri Tots and defeat them after spraying them with stimulant.{nl}Take the poison sacks from them after defeating them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000534	Good job.{nl}You'll have to move with me for the next ingredient.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000535	The next ingredient is the Yellow Wolfsbane.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000536	{nl}However, we can't use any flower.{nl}Only a professional will be able to see which flower can be used.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000537	{nl}I'll decide which flowers can be used since you won't be able to tell the difference.{nl}All you have to do is lead me to the flowers since I can't see where they are.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000538	They should be growing near Saalmas Falls.{nl}We should get moving at once.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000539	Thank you.{nl}I'll start mixing the poison.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000540	We have enough ingredients for the poison now.{nl}However...{nl}I seem to be fresh out of materials for the traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000541	{nl}The Kugheri Sommi always carry paralysis poison to use on small animals.{nl}It can be used on larger targets if you have enough of it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000542	{nl}Could you gather the poison from them?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000543	Thank you.{nl}I'll be making other preparations.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000544	Bring me paralysis poison gathered from the Kugheri Sommi.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000545	That took longer than expected.{nl}Let's go and finish the trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000546	We're all set to go.{nl}I just have to install this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000547	I tracked the beast and mixed the poison while you were gathering the poison for the trap.{nl}He leaves a red trail behind him. It may be a bit faint for you to see.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000548	{nl}I think it's because of the red gem he put through himself.{nl}Anyways, I found a small trail where he frequently goes by.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000549	{nl}I think we should install the trap on the way up to Saalmas Falls from Tredhalai Stream.{nl}I'll be hiding at Visuobene Falls and hit him with the poison arrow as soon as he is trapped.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000550	{nl}It should be enough to critically injure the beast.{nl}All you have to do is install the trap where I just described.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000551	Make sure to install it exactly where I described.{nl}I won't be able to hit him if it's not in the correct place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000552	Go and install the trap before the beast goes through.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000553	I'll have to rest here for a bit.{nl}Vaighe Hill is a dead end so we won't have to worry too much. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000554	{nl}You'll have to end it by yourself.{nl}It should have been weakened considerably because of the poison arrow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000555	Don't worry about me and go after it!{nl}Before it can recover!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000556	He's gone to a dead end.{nl}This is the opportune moment to finish it!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000557	We should recover all of the traps we set to catch the beast.{nl}We can't have people like you stepping on them now can we?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000558	May the Goddess bless your journey.{nl}I hope you will be able to succeed in your mission.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000559	I won't be caught out by the Kugheri even if I am wounded.{nl}Hurry after him and finish the job.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000560	Yes...{nl}The long fight has finally come to an end.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000561	{nl}I don't know when this would have ended if it wasn't for you.{nl}I think my eyesight is returning now that the beast is gone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000562	{nl}I owe you.{nl}I would appreciate it if you could stay behind and help me clean this place up...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000563	{nl}I'm sure you have your mission as Revelator.{nl}I don't know how I'll repay you for the help you gave.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000564	{nl}Farewell then.{nl}I wish you the best on your journey.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000565	Anyone who goes beyond this point will put their life at risk.{nl}Go back while you still can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000566	I advise you to be careful as there are violent Kugheri and armed traps.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000567	Refugee Mylija
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000568	I came here after hearing that it was okay, but I think it was a bad decision on my part.{nl}Monsters are crawling everywhere... People are fighting amongst each other...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000569	I can't beliece that it's been four years since Medzio Diena and they're still fighting over stupid land.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000570	At least they're talking to each other instead of simply fighting.{nl}I wish we could know who to rely on soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000571	I hope that everything will be finished without bloodshed.{nl}I'm a bit worried that there may be complications since they don't exactly have a good history together.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000572	I am thankful that the argument is over since they've decided to help us even if they haven't decided the winner.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000573	Thank you for your help Traveler.{nl}This was all thanks to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000574	Ah, it's you...{nl}Could you help us out?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000575	{nl}The food we've brought with us is long gone...{nl}We've asked the lords supposed to be ruling this region, but they are too busy squabbling between themselves to help us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000576	{nl}Since you seem to be capable of dealing with some monsters, we have no choice but to ask you...{nl}Could you please gather some tailfruit from the Yellow Leafnuts after dealing with them?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000577	Thank you.{nl}I think all that's left to eat around these parts are the tailfruits from the Leafnuts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000578	Please gather some tailfruit from the Yellow Leafnuts in the surrounding area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000579	Thank you so much.{nl}We'll manage for a while with these but... I hope that they'll decide who will rule this region as soon as possible...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000580	Refugee Greg
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000581	We came all the way here for help but have to fend for ourselves...{nl}This makes this place exactly like anywhere else.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000582	How could they be squabbling over land in such situations...{nl}I guess I can't expect any better from nobles can I...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000583	Well, at least they're better than the average noble.{nl}It seems like they've caught on to the situation after being attacked by monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000584	I heard that you were the reason behind their sudden agreement.{nl}I don't know how I will repay you for this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000585	Monsters are attacking us refugees a few times every single day.{nl}What's the use of having a lot of soldiers nearby.{nl}They're all busy protecting their lords.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000586	{nl}Even worse, they don't care if the refugees here die or not.{nl}All they seem to care about is getting more land under their boots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000587	{nl}That's why we have to look for ways to look after ourselves.{nl}I'm sorry, but could you please get us some strong branches from the nearby area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000588	{nl}We're planning on having them as weapons.{nl}I will have to stay here in order to carve their points to use as weapons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000589	Thank you so much for offering your help.{nl}We've already taken this much from the surrounding area, so you'll have to look over at Collegia Crossing for more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000590	{nl}There's always monsters near branches, so please be careful out there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000591	Be wary of monsters when collecting branches.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000592	Thank you.{nl}They all look very sturdy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000593	{nl}However, they are still just tree branches... We won't last long with these.{nl}We need the fighting between the two lords to end soon...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000594	{nl}Only the Goddess will know if they'll care about us even if it does end soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000595	I saw you helping Greg.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000596	{nl}I've seen you helping us out and dealing with monsters with ease...{nl}You don't seem to be just an ordinary traveler.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000597	{nl}We... we'll have to leave this place if the lords don't stop arguing soon.{nl}However, we are afraid of going into Emmet Forest because of the warnings and strange rumors about the place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000598	{nl}In other words, we don't have anywhere to go.{nl}So, please, could you find it in your heart to go and mediate?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000599	You'll help us right?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000600	{nl}Ah, thank the Goddesses...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000601	{nl}I'm sure that you'll manage to persuade them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000602	{nl}Lord Ryudhas is ruling over the land in place of his sick brother.{nl}He is a very stubborn man.{nl}He's staying at Dhuvus Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000603	{nl}Lord Joquvas is a young lad who has recently come into power.{nl}He is at Nevhrandi Crossroads with his tutor.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000604	{nl}We always get turned away every time we go near them.{nl}Please go and talk some sense into them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000605	Lord Ryudhas is at Dhuvus Lot,{nl}Lord Joquvas is at Nevhrandi Crossroads.{nl}Please convince them to stop arguing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000606	That was incredible!{nl}I didn't think that you'd be able to convince both of them...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000607	Lord Ryudhas

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000615	The reason I am fighting with the Joquvas lad?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000616	{nl}It's not even really a fight.{nl}I am simply notifying him of my family's right.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000617	{nl}I have in my possession an official document that proves my right to the land here.{nl}That miserable lad is merely being a nuisance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000618	{nl}I am not as compromising as my brother.{nl}This is the rightful land of the Ryudhas family.{nl}I will not back down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000619	I was wondering what sort of nonsense you would tell me.{nl}Why do I need to talk to the lad about my rightful land?

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000622	{nl}A few of my men seem to have caught a plague.{nl}They must be cured before it can spread so go and fetch me some roots from the Pysis plant.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000628	Another ingredient is needed to craft the medicine. The legs of the Orange Grummer.{nl}Of course, you'll need to forcefully take it from them, so it may be too much for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000629	{nl}Of course, I can simply give this task to another person if you don't want to do it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000630	Hmm... I am surprised.{nl}I don't know who you are, but why are you working so hard for the refugees?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000631	{nl}Well, whatever the case, fine.{nl}If you have decided to accept the task, go fetch me the Orange Grummer legs.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000637	{nl}I doubt he will be alarmed at you rummaging around.{nl}Could you get that box for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000638	{nl}I wish to take it to my ill brother.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000639	Good.{nl}I will consider talking to the lad if you get me that box.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000640	{nl}I suppose that the tree will still have the marks from when we were young but...{nl}From the state of the trees nearby, I think that it will also be covered in moss.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000641	{nl}The fluid of the Red Colimen has strong acidic properties so gather that first.{nl}After that, go and liquidify the moss on the trees and check for any marks.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000643	Go and get rid of the moss on trees at Atmintis Lot for a tree with marks.{nl}Dig under it to get a box.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000649	Roberta says that it is fine to listen even if it does not effect my decision.{nl}Therefore, I shall listen to what you have to say.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000650	If the refugees wish to receive my help, isn't it correct to recognize me as the rightful owner of this land first?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000651	You must go through me if you have anything to say to Lord Joquvas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000652	I have taught our lord since he was young.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000656	{nl}It's not like you're a Savior or anything.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000657	Of course, there would have been no doubt about this land belonging to the Joquvas family...{nl}But I suppose there is no choice but to change along with the times.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000658	I will convince our lord to be more mindful of the refugees once the new boundaries are settled.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000659	Joquvas Guard

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000672	{nl}I suppose that we will need to show more solid evidence.{nl}If you bring me what I ask of you, I will consider convincing our lord to listen to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000673	You'll be able to see some wreckage near Arcmnys Lake.{nl}It used to be the residence of our grounds keeper.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000675	Look for objects belonging to the Joquvas family near the wreckage at Arcmnys Lake.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000676	That is... a shield.{nl}I can confirm that there is a seal of the Joquvas family on it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000677	{nl}Very good, but this will not be enough.{nl}I believe that you must help with another task before I recognize you as worthy of audience.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000678	The Joquvas family always set up Monument made of stone.{nl}We will be able to make the refugees accept the Joquvas family as the rightful rulers.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000682	Good. We'll have to check Paccituche Trail, Skalda Road and Lyfetie Cliffs.{nl}Shall we go then?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000683	Good work.{nl}The refugees will now know who the rightful owner of this land is.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000697	Yes... This is not the time for us to argue over the land.{nl}We must stand together and fight back the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000698	It is as you have told me.{nl}We will be able to focus on ruling our land since the boundaries have been set.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000699	While I do think that this is my family's land...{nl}I suppose one should know how to take a step back under such circumstances.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000700	{nl}Ah well.{nl}I will negotiate with the Ryudhas about the new boundaries.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000701	The negotiations are over.{nl}We have decided to use this road as the boundary.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000702	{nl}We have decided to take care of the refugees now that the conflict has been settled.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000703	The lad is more agreeable than I thought he would be.{nl}We have decided to care for the refugees since the new boundary has been set.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000704	We will install notifications on the new boundary.{nl}I think that setting one at Pastoghe Bend, Collegia Crossing and Paccituche Trail should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000705	{nl}You have done well as mediator.{nl}I give my word that I will take care of the refugees.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000706	I don't like the results, but what can be done?{nl}The Ryudhas also had some good points in their arguements.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000707	The Kugheri Tribe and demons...{nl}Investigating Syla Forest has become much more dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000708	What I am attempting to do has the lives of many people on the line.{nl}However, it is... extremely difficult. I would appreciate it if I could get some help but...

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000710	I think that the ancient knowledge from the Royal Mausoleum of Taniel the Second will help the reconstruction of the Kingdom.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000711	Vhalterris was a powerful and tenacious demon.{nl}I doubt that anyone other than the Revelators would have been able to take Vhalterris down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000712	There shouldn't be anything in Taniel the Second's Royal Mausoleum fit for demons to go after...

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000714	Hmm?{nl}You must be quite skilled to make it this far.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000715	{nl}My name is Indraja, an adventurer.{nl}I have received a request to go and investigate places where the refugees might stay while the Kingdom is being reconstructed.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000733	Thank you.{nl}We were attacked by the Kugheri on behalf of the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000734	We knew that they didn't like humans, but we didn't know that they would attack us with such numbers.{nl}They must have made an agreement with the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000735	{nl}They are sure to be searching for us nearby.{nl}Please reduce their numbers a bit.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000736	General Lhamin is trying to reconstruct the Kingdom.{nl}He wishes to utilize anything possible to do so.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000737	{nl}He had come across a legend that had been passed down by Royalty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000738	{nl}It is said that Taniel the Second had created another Royal Mausoleum.{nl}It is said that much information was stored there to prepare for some sort of catastrophe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000739	{nl}The General firmly believes that the information stored there will be of great help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000740	{nl}It is said that you must be of Royal descent in order to find the Royal Mausoleum's entrance.{nl}That's why I have been honorably chosen as a far relative of the Royalty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000741	{nl}However, I never thought that the demons would be searching for the Royal Mausoleum as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000742	{nl}There were two demons, but I spread misinformation and made one to to Emmet Forest.{nl}The other followed us here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000743	{nl}We wouldn't have been able to continue on our mission if we hadn't met you here.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000745	Thank you.{nl}However, we won't be able to rest easy until we deal with the demon behind them.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000747	{nl}...{nl}These are the orders from the demon!

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000749	I wasn't able to decipher the orders you brought me.{nl}I am sure that there are more orders...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000750	{nl}Maybe I'll be able to make sense of them if I am able to compare and contrast the letters.{nl}I'm sorry, but could you please get me more of the demon's orders?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000751	Thank you. You said that you gathered them from the Kugheri Zabbi?{nl}Please get me more of them from the Kugheri Zabbi on the road to Stabhas Lot.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000752	The Kugheri Zabbi should have more orders.{nl}I might be able to make some sense of it with more references.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000753	Thank you.{nl}I'll try to figure out what the demon was scheming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000754	I've looked at all of the material you brought me.{nl}Where to begin...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000755	{nl}It is said that the demon going after the Royal Mausoleum is called Vhalterris.{nl}Unlike his colleague, he has been chasing us quite cleverly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000756	{nl}Marcus allowed us to both escape but...{nl}We lost a chest related to the Royal Mausoleum's secret.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000758	{nl}Revelator.{nl}I know that this is a difficult request, but could you please retrieve that chest for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000759	Thank you.{nl}He seems to be wondering around Apeighos Altar since he was unable to unravel the secret.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000760	Please retrieve the chest after defeating Vhalterris.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000761	Thank you.{nl}We've been able to get the chest back and remove the demon at the same time thanks to you!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000762	Now we'll be able to focus on searching for the entrance.{nl}However, there is something more I should tell you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000763	{nl}We will only be able to find the entrance if we solve various puzzles.{nl}The chest you brought back is the start of the puzzles.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000764	{nl}An important clue is stored in the chest you retrieved, but it will not simply open.{nl}We will have to learn how to open it with the five colors on this lock.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000765	{nl}According to legend, there are five trees near the hidden entrance of the Royal Mausoleum, and those trees will indicate different colors.{nl}I can't leave Marcus behind, so could you please survey the trees instead?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000766	Here, take this engraving and map.{nl}This engraving, which has the Royal Seal, is said to have magic infused on it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000767	{nl}It is said to be part of a set with the box and will react to the trees there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000768	{nl}The map is supposed to have the location of the trees marked on it.{nl}Go to each tree marked on the map and see which colors it reacts to.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000769	Go to the trees marked on the map and use the Royal Seal to see how they react to each tree.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000770	I sent Marcus back to Fedimian since he recovered enough to travel by himself.{nl}How is your investigation going?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000771	{nl}Red... and blue...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000772	{nl}Ah...!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000773	{nl}Of course!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000774	{nl}I think I know how to open it!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000775	The chest has opened!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000776	{nl}Let's see here... There's a stone slate.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000777	{nl}Let me see what it says.{nl}Hmm...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000778	Grasp the time at which you are granted audience with the King.{nl}The guardian will appear as the King looks down upon your last light.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000779	{nl}Ah... This seems to be another riddle.{nl}We should go to Lykhas Crossroads since it's mentioned in the records and go see what can be found.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000780	There was a bit more content on the slate...{nl}It seems as if it requires the blood from royalty to be read.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000781	{nl}I suppose this was the reason they needed royalty to find the entrance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000782	{nl}However, the seal seems to be damaged since it has been passed down for generations.{nl}It seems to have consumed all of it's magic when you where investigating the trees.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000783	{nl}We'll have to look for a way to recharge the seal.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000784	All that's left is to find the Royal Mausoleum's entrance since we've seen the guardian.{nl}Please stick around a little bit more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000785	I don't know too much about how it's working, but I do think that it's impressive they created such seals a few hundred years ago.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000786	I was able to finish General Lhamin's mission thanks to you.{nl}Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000787	We'll need to reseal this Royal Mausoleum to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000788	I have no idea on how to recharge the magic though...{nl}Do you have any good ideas?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000789	Will that work?{nl}I somehow feel as if this isn't your first time doing this...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000790	{nl}Well, let's try your idea then.{nl}Please fill the seal with Kugheri Tribe souls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000791	Please fill the seal with Kugheri Tribe souls.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000792	However, we can't go into the Royal Mausoleum like this.{nl}We'll need to report back to the General and get a proper survey team here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000793	{nl}Leaving the entrance open like this won't do though...{nl}We shoul reseal the entrance now that we know where it's exact location is now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000794	{nl}Could you help me a bit more?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000795	We can't use the Royal Seal to reseal the entrance...{nl}Especially since there's a risk of it being destroyed...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000796	{nl}We'll have to find something to replace it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000797	{nl}The Kugheri Numani carry staffs adorned with bells that they use for their rituals.{nl}I'm sure that the bells have some sort of power that allows them to use their magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000798	{nl}I'll look for a way to reseal the entrance while you gather the staffs.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000799	Please gather me the staffs from the Kugheri Numani from the surrounding area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000800	Good job.{nl}I hope this works... 
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000801	{nl}I hope the staffs you gathered will contain enough magic...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000802	It worked!{nl}The Royal Mausoleum entrance has been resealed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000803	{nl}I wasn't sure if this would work.{nl}I'll be able to return and report without worrying too much now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000804	The entrance has been resealed.{nl}However, there are still a few of the Kugheri Tribe that know where the entrance is located.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000805	{nl}We need to make sure that the location doesn't get into the hands of any demons.{nl}Please make sure there aren't any loose ends.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000806	There will still be some Kugheri that followed Vhalterris.{nl}Please deal with them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000807	It seems as if most of the Kugheri that had followed Vhalterris have been dealt with.{nl}Please make sure that there are no more loose ends and deal with the rest of the Kugheri Tribe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000808	This information must be kept from getting into the hands of the demons.{nl}Please prevent the Kugheri Tribe from talking.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000809	Good job.{nl}However, there are still some Kugheri that had followed Vhalterris.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000810	It may seem a bit extreme, but they brought this upon themselves when they decided to cooperate with the demons.{nl}Anyhow, this should be enough.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000811	{nl}The Kugheri Tribe here will not be able to talk so easily now...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000812	{nl}It seems as if I keep owing you.{nl}If you ever get the chance to see General Lhamin, please remember to stop by and say hello.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000816	I suppose there's no choice but to quickly retrieve what we've came for before heading back.{nl}I'll happily accept any help you can offer.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000817	I don't have the faintest clue as to why goblins might want parchment.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000818	I had no idea that there would be such a monster threatening the goblins.{nl}Whatever the case may be, we were able to finish up quickly thanks to your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161005_000819	I think the end of this mission is in sight.{nl}We'll start preparing to head back as soon as all of my men get back.

QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001350	Uh...? Are you here because of the warning...?{nl}No, let us talk later.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001351	{nl}First, take this medicine, quick.{nl}This area is being affected by the dangerous Nobreer epidemic!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001352	{nl}Even the Plague Doctor Master has been unable to identify the source of the epidemic.{nl}It was discovered in the residents of Nobreer Forest after Medzio Diena.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001353	{nl}Falling ill means you can end in a slow, torturous death.{nl}Take it before it's too late, hurry!
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001354	I hope it won't be too late.{nl}The medicine is not yet complete, you see.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001355	As of now it is more of a preventative drug, rather than a cure.{nl}It won't have any effect if you are already ill, so please hurry and take it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001356	If you feel feverish or dizzy, even a little... Please, let me know.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001357	I'm glad you seem to be safe.{nl}My name is Jugrinas.{nl}I'm a Plague Doctor and I'm researching the Nobreer epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001358	{nl}As I mentioned earlier, the epidemic was first found in refugee groups.{nl}The Plague Doctor Master was only able to stop it from spreading, but no more than that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001359	{nl}After progress slowed down, Cicas and I were sent here by the Master to research the disease.{nl}Unfortunately, we missed the right time to take the medicine and fell ill.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001360	{nl}Someone should be replacing us soon, as we find it too difficult to move the patients.{nl}I simply regret having to go back with no results.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001361	{nl}Thinking about all the patients still suffering from horrible pain, I...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001362	Will you really?{nl}I'm terribly sorry to ask since it's our first time meeting but...{nl}I will accept your favor, for the good of the patients.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001363	I left a few containers near the entrance of Emmet Forest with a solution that absorbs airborne substances.{nl}If any are connected to the disease, they'll have been absorbed by it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001364	Will you bring me some of that testing solution?{nl}I left a few spread around the area, so you may collect a little from each container.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001365	I just hope there'll be substances worth analyzing in the testing solution...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001366	You're back.{nl}Let me have a look.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001367	Hmm... I don't see anything worthy of note.{nl}It seems the disease isn't caused by any airborne substances...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001368	It's a bit time-consuming, but I'm afraid I have no choice but to use the Pandemic Detectors.{nl}It's a device created by the Plague Doctor Master to detect the disease's energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001369	It was meant to be used to find patients but... I figure we can use it to find the source of the disease as well.{nl}I'll hand you the detectors; you may install them at the Nobreer Intersection.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001370	Around three detectors should be enough to cover the intersection.{nl}After some time you should be able to see a reaction.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001371	This is surest way to know, but there's no telling how long it could take.{nl}It could be days before there's any visible reaction.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001372	Did you install the detectors?{nl}Now we simply need to wait for a reaction.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001373	While we wait for the detectors to react, it would be best to carry on with other research.{nl}As I said, there's no telling when it will happen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001374	I say we should collect some samples from the forest plants.{nl}I believe there are some sample collecting tools among the things we left at the Lower Shipping Station.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001375	Cicas was too ill to get them organized.{nl}Please find the sample collecting tools and gather a few plant samples.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001376	After you find the tools, head to the Nobreer Falls and collect the samples.{nl}We will need samples of plants like herbs and roots.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001377	If we're unable to find anything from the plants, we'll have to investigate the monsters.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001378	Did you bring the plant samples?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001379	Let's have a look then...{nl}There doesn't seem to be anything worthy of note here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001380	I'm afraid we're going to need some samples from the monsters.{nl}That is, if you will help me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001381	Collecting monster samples requires a specific chemical.{nl}I believe Cicas had it, but due to his condition he had to leave it at the site we were investigating.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001382	If you go to Big Tree Footbridge, you'll find the special solution Cicas was using, along with some sample containers.{nl}I can't be sure where exactly he left them, however.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001383	After you find the solution and the containers, go to the Upper Shipping Station.{nl}Spray the solution over a few monsters there, then defeat them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001384	If a monster dies, its cells will break down, meaning the data will be inaccurate.{nl}The solution is needed to stop the cells from breaking down.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001385	Let us hope the pandemic detectors react meanwhile.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001386	Oh, these are very well preserved.{nl}Let's have a look...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001387	Hmm... There's certainly a type of energy here...{nl}But I'm afraid it's not enough to be sure...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001388	I can't tell if there's a connection with the Nobreer Epidemic.{nl}I need to go back and investigate it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001389	For now I suppose we can check the detectors for a reaction.{nl}Would you bring back the epidemic detectors installed at the Nobreer Intersection?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001390	I sure hope there's been a reaction...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001391	If the detectors haven't reacted, I'll be going home empty-handed.{nl}I'm worried for the patients of the disease...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001392	What? {nl}You saw something surrounded by an ominous energy head towards the Evac Route?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001393	I can feel a very strong energy from the detectors your brought back, too.{nl}It does feel similar to the energy of the disease... Although slightly different.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001394	It's certainly very strong and evil.{nl}Whatever you saw at the Nobreer Intersection could very well be the source of the epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001395	Come to think of it, I have heard talks of a Demonic Plague before.{nl}A dark demon that brings misery and despair unto humans.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001396	If what you saw was this demon... It could mean grave danger.{nl}We ought to be careful.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001397	Remember to be careful.{nl}If it really is the Demonic Plague, it will be very dangerous.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001398	In any case, we may just get some clues about the cure from this demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001399	Did you really defeat the Demonic Plague?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001400	And you brought its core.{nl}I'm certain this is the source of the epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001401	If I bring this back to the Plague Doctor Master, he'll be able to produce a cure.{nl}Thank you so much.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001402	The person who's here to replace us has just arrived.{nl}Cicas isn't feeling very well either, so we should be on our way now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001403	Your precious help will always be remembered.{nl}After all, you are the one who saved all those suffering from the epidemic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001404	There's a disease spreading around here.{nl}You should leave while you still can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001405	I must think of those suffering from the Nobreer Epidemic and find a clue.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001406	Kupole Lenja
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001407	I am a Kupole at the service of Goddess Laima.{nl}I'm waiting for the right time here under Her orders.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001408	The treaty that goddesses and demons signed many, many eras ago is more than a simple agreement.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001409	One of my tasks is soon to be completed, it seems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001410	I do regret not paying closer attention to Laima's words, but we mustn't stop.{nl}The world is not quite over yet.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001411	I'm certain there will be other many actions to take, I believe Her words.{nl}Surely She still has hope.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001412	Welcome.{nl}I was waiting for you, Savior.{nl}My name is Kupole Lenja, I serve Goddess Laima.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001413	{nl}A time longer than 1000 years ago, Goddess Laima foresaw that you would arrive.{nl}She said there would be something here that must be passed unto you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001414	{nl}The truth of a distant era... A story of goddesses and demons.{nl}For a long, long time, I have waited here for you to arrive and face this truth.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001415	{nl}Savior, follow Her words. Retrieve the ancient treaty here kept and confirm this truth.{nl}For the world, for you, and for those foolish enough to have doubted Her words four years in the past...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001416	Goddess Laima did not tell me how to retrieve the treaty.{nl}She must have not wanted anyone but the Savior to access it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001417	{nl}She wrote the instructions to obtaining the treaty on a book called the Prophecy Tome.{nl}She made sure only the Savior would be allowed to acquire the Tome.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001418	{nl}To receive the Prophecy Tome, you must prove that you are the Savior.{nl}You may attest your status to the three stone pagodas of Pranasyste Way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001419	{nl}Prove to them that you are the Savior and the Prophecy Tome will appear to you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001420	Everything must be done by the Savior, and the Savior alone.{nl}My task is merely to deliver to you the instructions and wait.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001421	Did you find the Prophecy Tome?
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001422	The Tome was made by the power of Goddess Laima.{nl}Therefore, it can only be seen through the power of fate.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001423	Her power is imbued in the Orb of Fate located in Rechimas Way.{nl}You must first receive the power of the Orb in order to read the Prophecy Tome.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001424	All I can do from here is wait for you to acquire the treaty and return.{nl}Everything you need to know will be written in the Prophecy Tome. I will be waiting at the Yudejan Altar.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001425	The demons have started to wander around Yudejan Forest.{nl}They covet the treaty that's hidden here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001426	{nl}They must not want the Savior to obtain it.{nl}Goddess Laima did make provisions for this moment, but still...
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001427	{nl}If you cross paths with a demon, eliminating it would be the wisest thing to do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001428	My role is to merely relay unto you the words of Goddess Laima and look over the developments.{nl}All else is dependent on you alone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001429	I can only tell you to beware of the demons that covet the treaty.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001430	You have obtained the treaties and the slate.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001431	Now you must read the contents of the treaty.{nl}You can do so at the Yudejan Altar.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001432	Place the treaty slate in the Yudejan Altar, then set the goddess treaty and the demon treaty.{nl}The contents of the treaty should then be revealed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001433	I know neither its contents nor what they will mean to you.{nl}But if it was Laima's will to pass onto you this message through Her prophecy, surely they are important.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001434	The treaty was signed a thousand... No, more than a thousand years ago, by both demons and goddesses.{nl}Perhaps you already knew this, or perhaps you're surprised to hear it for the first time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001435	All I'm certain of is that you must know the contents of the treaty.{nl}That is what Goddess Laima prepared for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001436	I wonder if things would have been different had we listened to Laima.{nl}It's too late for that, I suppose.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001437	Did you read the treaty?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001438	I know not what meaning the treaty will have to you.{nl}I was simply told that it was meant for the eyes of the Savior.
QUEST_LV_0400_20161214_001439	The future depends on you now.{nl}Every choice you make shall be a step towards the salvation of our world.{nl}

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001628	Ah! During the day, people of the Great Woodlands would crush raspberries and sprinkled them around the forest.{nl} This would cause the Starlight to appear.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001630	Wait.{nl}Take this with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001631	It'll be easier to collect Raspberry Juice if you use this bottle.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001636	We've attracted enough starlight, I think...{nl}But still I don't see anything...

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001640	Goddess Medeina must be talking about the butterflies that come to the flower as the preachers of love.{nl}But "Half of my heart" and "stone"?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001641	This meaning isn't clear.{nl}Is it really talking about a stone? "Half of my heart" must be about the Goddess's heart...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001642	Is the stone really just a stone with no other meaning?{nl}If that's true, is the Goddess' heart written on stone?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001643	I really can't think of the meaning.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001644	The stone, really is just a stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001645	It seems I was thinking too deeply.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001656	Narvas Temple was made by Agailla Flurry to seal the three divided parts of Hauberk.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001679	To change the detectors, the detector and its auxiliary systems must be shut down.{nl}Yet, there are numerous systems. If even one turns back on, the remaining ones will also turn on. Making the task difficult.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001693	If it continues like this, this defensive system will be completed destroyed.{nl}To cool it down, we need to remove all the energy and turn it off.{nl}If we do not, we will lose the whole system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001694	I have a request for you.{nl}When I remove the energy it will escape out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001695	At this time, please collect the energy into the Energy Storing Globe.{nl}Then use that energy to reactivate the defensive system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001696	I will now turn off the system.{nl}Please wait until I have altered it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001697	Monk Aistis is currently altering the defensive system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001698	Defensive system alterations are complete.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001699	To reactive the defensive system we will need to slowly increase the output.{nl}And to increase the output, we will need a lot of energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001700	As I increase the output, I will need you to continually insert all the energy you previously collected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001701	Each time the defensive system requires it, insert the energy you just collected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001702	The defensive system has activated.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001703	After checking that the defensive system is working properly, we can leave.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001704	We nearly left Narvas Temple open to the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001705	The defensive system seems to be working well. We can make our way back inside.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001706	Agailla Flurry created various demon suppressing, demon weakening, and defensive systems in Narvas Temple.{nl}This was done to defend against invading demons and those trying to release Hauberk's seal. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001707	However, after Medzio Diena these systems were weakened and unable to function properly.{nl}To make matters worse, the demons came and destroyed a few of them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001708	We need to prevent other systems from being destroyed while also repairing them to stop Hauberk's return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001709	Good.{nl}Let us move on to the demon weakening systems in Atsargus Hall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001710	This is good. It seems we have prevented the demons from destroying this system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001711	This one can weaken the demon's strength.{nl}If we just alter its functions and reinforce it a bit we can use it to limit their power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001712	It will be okay.{nl}The demons will have no idea that their strength has been weakened.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001713	I will handle altering the system. Traveler, I need you to collect Strong Essence of Demon that we can use as energy.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001714	It feels like the demons would notice, but trust him and go collect the Strong Essence of Demon
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001715	Please do not worry yourself, the demons will pay us no mind.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001716	Reinforcing is complete.{nl} Now on to the systems in Atsargus Hallway.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001717	Hauberk's scouts have already broken this device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001718	Luckily, since the core of the device has not taken too much damage, I will be able to fix and alter it.{nl}However, would you be willing to help me with one part?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001719	This system, in order to locate unholy beings, runs only on clean essence.{nl}This was to prevent not only demons from coming into the temple but heretics as well. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001720	However, since the area is now overrun with demons, it will be more effective if I alter the system to focus simply on them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001721	For it to properly track demons, we will need to mix Demon's Blood and Essence together and insert it into the device.{nl}Please collect some tainted essence mixed with Demon's Blood.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001722	I do understand the unpleasantness of this task.{nl}But this is all to prevent Hauberk's return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001723	It will be fine if you just return with Essence mixed with Demon's Blood. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001724	Please put in the Essence you collected.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001725	Wait a minute. Hauberk is over there.{nl}If you run in hastily, he will capture you and do the same thing he did to the others.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001726	There are too many demons.{nl}It would be better if we first go to Ziureti Hall and check on the system there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001727	We do not have time to waste.{nl}We should go now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001728	It is extremely dangerous.{nl}They have already passed on.{nl}We must retreat.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001729	Do you now understand how dangerous this is?{nl}Hauberk could have easily have caught us as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001730	Sigh...{nl}Luckily, you successfully interrupted whatever Hauberk was doing. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001731	However, if you were caught, I too would be in danger. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001732	Let us not argue and focus on examining the system that is on the way to Ziureti Hall. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001733	Unidentified Facility
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001734	Speak with you...I am Agailla Flurry...apparition...

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001742	...completed year...enter locked system password...bring it...put in device...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001743	Agailla Flurry's Spirit
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001744	I wasn't able to convey myself fully, however you still knew to unlock the system, bring the Apparition Generator, and fix the device. I'm impressed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001745	You are talking with me, Agailla Flurry's Apparition, also known as the manager of Narvas Temple. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001746	I left most of the tasks to the monks, but since the three Hauberks woke up and you have arrived, I've decided to intervene.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001747	Monk Aistis' fear of dying at the hands of Ambition Hauberk left his mind weak.{nl}This made it easier for Deception Hauberk to hypnotize Aistis and gain the upper hand.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001748	Deception Hauberk did not anticipate your arrival.{nl}However, after you met Monk Aistis in Izoliacjia Plateau, Deception Hauberk decided to use you aswell.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001749	You were fooled by Deception Hauberk, but the tables have turned. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001750	In this temple is the ruthless, highly ambitions, but non-resourceful, Ambition Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001751	The constantly suspicious, concerned with preservation and always careful, is Suspicion Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001752	For thousands of years, preparing but not revealing his true intentions to the others, is Deception Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001753	To become whole they are keeping each other in check, under contact that they will not involve themselves in each others work.{nl}However, little by little Deception Hauberk is shifting the balance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001754	The problem is Deception Hauberk is taking the lead to return to his former self, Demon Lord Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001755	If this happens we will not be able to stop Demon Lord Hauberk's return.{nl}You and I will use the current imbalance to defeat Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001756	Help Monk Aistis and, to completely break the balance of power, take my staff to Deception Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001757	I awaited your return.{nl}If you hand over the magic crystal you collected, I will improve the system.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001758	In Ziureti Hall, the weapon that can defy Hauberk, Agailla Flurry's Staff is protected by a device..{nl}We should there and collect the staff.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001759	Return to Monk Aistis and follow what he says.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001760	Able to defy Hauberk, Agailla Flurry's Staff contains an enormous amount power.{n}Thus, if demons are around, the device protecting the staff will not open.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001761	When there are no demons around, you'll be able to open it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001762	You can open the device now.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001763	Agailla Flurry Apparition
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001764	With that, the balance of power has been shattered.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001765	Use this imbalance of power ignite a fight amongst themselves.{nl}I will explain more in Narvas Temple Annex.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001766	Deception Hauberk has acquired Agailla Flurry's staff but to become whole he must absorb Ambition Hauberk and Suspicion Hauberk.{nl}And to explain to the other two Hauberks, without any misunderstand, the events that have occurred here will be difficult. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001767	However, Deception Hauberk has not concerned himself with how he will go about absorbing the remaining two.{nl}This we will take advantage of.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001768	We will make it obvious to the other two Hauberks that Deception Hauberk is planning an attack.{nl}Plant the idea that Deception Hauberk is weakening them in order to easily absorb them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001769	Now, if you say that the system in Deception Hauberk's Sealed Hall has been altered, Monk Aistis will say otherwise.{nl}His response will be obvious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001770	This is because he does not know what goes on here.{nl}Do not worry about the systems. Instead go to Deception Hauberk and do as I have said.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001771	Do not concern yourself with the connection between this and the systems.{nl}If you trust me and follow what I say, we will stop Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001772	I will consider what needs to be done and tell you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001773	If you wish to fix this system, I will need parts from Flurry's device.{nl}These parts are small making them hard to find.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001774	Please use this Absorbing Stone.{nl}When you use it it will  attract the small parts and pull them towards you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001775	Please use the Absorbing Stone and bring Flurry's Device Parts to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001776	Agailla Flurry Apparition
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001777	Just as I wanted, you have conveyed the message to Deception Hauberk.{nl}You did well in such a dangerous situation.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001778	Now, we must make Suspicion Hauberk and Ambition Hauberk aware of Deception Hauberk's actions.{nl}Once they are aware, they will begin to fight.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001779	We will start by informing Suspicion Hauberk.{nl}However, seeing as he is a filled with suspicion, if we do not prepare correctly, he will not fall into our trap. Rather he will simply become more suspicious.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001780	You must ransform into the trusted King Hammer and inform him of Deception Hauberk's plan.{nl}Suspicion Hauberk believes himself to be the weakest of the Hauberks. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001781	Therefore, he will concern himself with how to become whole.{nl}At that point, you most reveal the Contract Token you are carrying.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001782	He and the other Hauberks have searched madly for this item that, when he sees it, it will increase his trust in you.{nl}And, tell Hauberk that the Token needs to be changed before use or it will inflict great harm.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001783	If Suspicion Hauberk is of sound mind, he will say to do this right away.{nl}Then leave Suspicion Hauberk's Sealed Hall and come to Ketinimas Hall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001784	Agailla Flurry left preparations in case Hauberk was awakened and turned his attacks on the monks.{nl}It's the device right next to me. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001785	So that the monks could safety evacuate, this device creates scrolls that change the appearance of the user into a monster. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001786	To create a King Hammer transformation scroll you will need a body essence.{nl}If you collect the Flesh of Black Hohen Olben, you can use that in the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001787	First go and collect the Flesh of Black Hohen Olben.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001788	You have done well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001789	Now we need King Hammer's Blood.{nl}In time, the King Hammers searching for the Contract Token will be passing this way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001790	Defeat them and insert the King Hammer's Blood into the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001791	The transformation scroll is complete.{nl}Now, use this scroll to transform into King Hammer and approach Suspicion Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001792	You made that look too easy. Well done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001793	Now, changing the power within the Contract Token is not easy.{nl}While you were away, I changed the function of the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001794	It took time, but it turned out well.{nl}However, the device still does not have the energy it needs to change the power within the Contract Token.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001795	Replacing the energy with condensed magic will be suitable.{nl}Yes, strengthening it with condensed magic will do the trick.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001796	To gain strength, each of Hauberk's Drooper Scouts are in possession of one.{nl}If you defeat them you'll be able to obtain the condensed magic. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001797	Gather it and insert it into the device.{nl}When you have inserted enough, insert the Contract Token and I will transform its power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001798	You think it's easy changing the Token's power?{nl}Well, in case it was necessary, Agailla Flurry did prepare changeable functions for the devices.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001799	I have changed the power within the Contract Token.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001800	Please inform Suspicion Hauberk of the Contract Token's change.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001801	Suspicion Hauberk has been taken in by your wonderful acting.{nl}We are a little pressed for time, so I will relay the next stage of the plan at Ambition Hauberk's Sealed Hall.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001802	You have arrived.{nl}Now we must reel in Ambition Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001803	Ambition Hauberk's Elite Banshee King has died by your hand, correct?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001804	When you defeated the Banshee King, the tortured monks we released.{nl}Due to that, reeling Ambition Hauberk in will not be difficult. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001805	Instead, it will be easier.{nl}You'll be able to brainwash the Black Harugal residing under Ambition Hauberk. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001806	There is one device created by the monks.{nl}It was created by the High Monk in order for them to not forget the important matters at hand. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001807	That device is right here.{nl}If you record the matter into the device it prints it on the Registry Orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001808	For a short period of time, one will not forget the demands contained in the Orb.{nl}To make it simple, you can think of it as a type of suggestive brainwashing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001809	To create this Registry Orb we only need to record two sentences into the device. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001810	First 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001811	Deception Hauberk secretly discarded the monk need to transform the spirits. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001812	{nl}Second 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001813	To attack Ambition Hauberk, the Monastery's systems were altered.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001814	Maybe there will not be enough words to choose from.{nl}Combine what you can and I will perfect the sentences.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001815	Rememebr, you only need to record two sentences into the Registry Device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001816	Selecting the words must have been difficult, yet you did well and created the perfect Registry Orb. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001817	Among the Black Harugal are Ambition Hauberk's elite servants. They are marked with a special essence.{nl}This essence is difficult for the human eye to spot.{nl}However, there is a way around this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001818	Collect the essence of the Black Harugal and we can use it to create an orb that will be able to determine which of the Harugal are Ambition Hauberk's elite servants.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001819	Good.{nl}I will now make an orb that will be able to differentiate Ambition Hauberk's elite servants from amongst the Black Harugal
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001820	Just insert the Black Harugal's essence into the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001821	Using the Black Harugal essence for comparison, I have made a Mark of Identification that can spot the elite servant.{nl}Use the Mark of Identification to single out Ambition Hauberk's elite servant and then use the Registry Orb. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001822	But I must deliver a warning before you go.{nl}The suggestive power of the Registry Orb does not last long.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001823	And if there is resistance, the effects of the Registry Orb will not be seen.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001824	You must work to weaken the Black Harugal before using the Orb.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001825	And when you use the Mark of Identification, a red glow will appear over the head of Ambition Hauberk's elite servant. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001826	Ambition Hauberk will definitely go to Deception Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001827	Wait one moment.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001828	Since Elite King Hammer has not returned, distrust has grown inside Suspicion Hauberk. He is on his way to Deception Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001829	Give Monk Aistis Flurry's Device Parts and alter the equipment.{nl}When that is completed, Ambition Hauberk and Suspicion Hauberk will draw near.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001830	If Suspicion Hauberk and Ambition Hauberk see Deception Hauberk with humans, they will not stand idly by.{nl}Especially Ambition Hauberk.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001831	When it appears that they will start to fight, Revelator, turn on the altered system.{nl}The Hauberks will back off when it reacts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001832	Well then, take the portal device besides me and be on your way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001833	What took you so long?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001834	It took you this long to find the parts? Well let me see the parts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001835	You did not falter in this situation at all. Well done.{nl}Just as we prepared, the Hauberks will fight amongst themselves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001836	There is great power in the Contract Token that will inflict both damage and sap one's energy.{nl}However, you cannot be careless.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001837	Hauberk will sustain a great amount of damage, but he will be stronger and will recover quickly.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001838	Before Hauberk completely retains his power, all of Narvas Temple's energy will be directed to one location in order to defeat him.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001839	I am speaking of the systems Aistis altered.{nl}In the Temple's control system is the Central Control Terminal. The Central Control Terminal will change the system's function set up.{nl}I can change the system myself but I cannot make the final decision. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001840	What I need, Revelator, is for you to make that decision.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001841	Good.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001842	Suspicion Hauberk's elite servants damaged the Central Control Terminal and carried away parts of it.{nl}I need you to find these parts and repair the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001843	Once the functions have been set, press the button and the temple's systems will stop running.{nl}This will also affect the systems outside of Narvas Temple. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001844	Right when the systems reboot use the portal.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001845	Take the portal back to Deception Hauberk's Sealed Hall and battle Hauberk.{nl}I will power up the systems altered by Monk Aistis and when they reach the same level of power as Hauberk's I will inform you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001846	Use the system and attack him.{nl}And I know what I am asking of you is unreasonable. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001847	But I am not asking because you are the Revelator.{nl}I am asking because of the courage, will, and power I saw from you today.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001848	So, I ask that you help me see this to the end.

QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001991	Goddess Vaivora knows much more than you or Neringa, expect for the future.{nl}Therefore it is impossible to convince Vaivora
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001992	Vaivora will now make an extreme choice.{nl}Give up the revelation and remove Giltine from this world.{nl}She still thinks that is correct.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001993	In the meantime, let's move to Valandis Room 3.{nl}There you and Neringa will listen to the Goddess plans and follow.{nl}Neringa will go first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001994	Goddess Vaivora has instructed you to collect all the magical energy that can be used on the Sealing Altar.{nl}There are devices around the library that you can collect the magic from.{nl}Please activate them.{nl}The activated magic devices will go where they are needed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001995	There was a human who came here without an invitation.{nl}But you are the first to be formally invited.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001996	That looks like enough.{nl}Also, Neringa is looking for you.{nl}It would be good if you go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001997	{nl}I will finish the rest of the work here.{nl} I will be off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001998	I'm surprised by your work.{nl}Human potential seems to know no bounds.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_001999	To play a part in continuing human history, I will tell you something.{nl}Several hundred years ago, Demon Goddess Giltine had already invaded this place.{nl}She was looking for a record of herself.{nl}But at the time she could not obtain it.{nl}So she comes again today.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002000	I do not know where she will use it.{nl}But she is coming to this place soon to get her hands on that record.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002001	We have taken advantage of her greed by preparing a trap.{nl}As she becomes overcome with joy for finally getting her hands on the record, she will disappear from this world.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002002	If she disappears from this world, every problem will be solved.{nl}All of the Goddesses will return to their rightful places and you too may go home. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002003	For this I need your help.{nl}My Kupole are in the final stages of perfecting the trap.{nl}Please help them.{nl}I also have last minute preparations. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002004	Once again, thank you for your courage and you sacrifice.{nl}For the sake of the world, please endure just a little bt longer.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002005	Please collect them quickly!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002006	How's the protection crystal?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002007	Danute is still unfocused.{nl}This may be a handful for a human such as yourself.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002008	But if you have nothing else to do...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002009	Vaivora wants to destroy part of the Fantasy Library in order to prevent others from entering.{nl}But it will not go according to the Goddess' wish.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002010	It's quite unfortunate.{nl}To ensure that the prediction comes true, you must artfully disrupt the Goddess's plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002011	And the Goddess must not know that you and Neringa are the ones to blame.{nl}So follow the Goddess's plans for awhile.{nl}When it is time to execute our own plan, Neringa will call you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002012	To sacrifice a part of the district to capture Giltine.{nl}Vaivora's plan seems reckless.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002013	Vaivora will ask you to activate the sealing device set up in Valandis Room 3.{nl}Go about the task.{nl}Neringa will also do as such.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002014	{nl}Go to Vaivora.{nl}Neringa will call you when it is time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002015	Time is running out and there are not many Kupoles remaining that I can call...{nl}You will be able to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002016	{nl}Here Skywa is helping me to operate the Bluenode Collapsing Device.{nl}But the energy from this device is calling demons to it.{nl}Please go there and protect the device for me.{nl}If we lose even one, Giltine will slip away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002017	It hurts me as well to make such a decision.{nl}And I will bear this crime for eternity. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002018	{nl}But to save the world from Giltine's grip...{nl}It's an expensive sacrifice that must be done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002019	Amazing!{nl}The activated collapsing device will conceal its magic, and will not face attack again.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002020	{nl}Now Skywa will activate the collapsing device remotely.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002021	Next we need to activate the second collapsing device.{nl}However, it does not have enough energy to run.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002022	Gather the Monumental Magic Source around the area of the second collapsing device.{nl}After that, listen to Neringa about what to do next.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002023	{nl}I will return after surveilling Valandis Room 91.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002024	I will not be gone long.{nl}However, while I am away please consult Neringa if you need help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002025	Our goal is to cause the Balanorth Collapsing Device to overload.{nl}Until then we will continue to follow Vaivora's plan, so as to not alert suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002026	Skywa is walking around and managing the collapsing devices.{nl}Operating them is simple enough. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002027	Insert the Monumental Magic Source that you have in your possession into the device.{nl}As the device re-energizes, protect it until it can conceal its magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002028	Right now the Goddess is checking on Demon Goddess Giltine's rampage in Valandis Room 91.{nl}As pressing as the matter is, the Goddess will not use the Fantasy Library as a burial ground for Giltine.{nl}Please follow the plan thoughtfully and reliably.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002029	You have successfully energized the device.{nl}It's good to know the plan is right on schedule.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002030	{nl}Giltine is currently in Valandis Room 91 searching frankly for the revelation.{nl}Let us finally finish the task before us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002031	Now, there are only a few devices left to run.{nl}But is there enough time to leave everything to Skywa...{nl}And it would be difficult to protect.{nl}Would you be willing to help Skywa?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002032	{nl}Make your way to Ballandans collapsing device.{nl}Skywa will be waiting for you there. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002033	Kupole Skywa
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002034	The human helping Vaivora is you?{nl}This is my first time seeing one, but you seem particularly strong.{nl}I have a job for you..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002035	Skywa cannot complete this work alone.{nl}Make sure to help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002036	Not too long ago, I set the Ballandans Collapsing Device.{nl}I was going to activate another device here as well, but the demons swarmed me.{nl}If I waste my time on them, I won't be able to finish the work Vaivora gave me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002037	{nl}How about clearing out those demons from around the Ballandans collapsing device?{nl}You just need to protect it until the device is set and conceals itself..{nl}While you deal with this, I'll be able to go and finish my other remaining tasks. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002038	Thank you so much!{nl}Humans are so kind, no?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002039	{nl}Alright, I'm going to go finish my other preparations.{nl}I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002040	Your help is appreciated.{nl}Thanks to you, Skywa was able to complete the rest of the preparations.{nl}Now only Balanorth collapsing device is left.{nl}Shall I give this remaining task to you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002041	{nl}When all is ready, just turn on the device.{nl}Oh, right Neringa was looking for you.{nl}It seems she also needs your help.{nl}I'll wait here for your successful return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002042	Everything has been prepared.{nl}And Vaivora has no reason to distrust you.{nl}You received the request to handle the Balanorth collapsing device, no?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002043	When activating that device, the demon leaders will appear and interrupt you.{nl}When the demon leaders are defeated they will release great amounts of energy.{nl}We will use that.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002044	Please lure the head monsters closer to the Balanorth device and defeat them there.{nl}Their released energy will overheat the device and destroy it.{nl}Then Vaivora's mission will fail in its final step.{nl}Once you have completed this task, you and Neringa will go together to Valandis Room 91. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002045	{nl}Please do not forget.{nl}You must defeat the head monsters when they are nearest to the device. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002046	All of history is recorded in Fantasy Library.{nl}Of course, records about you are also here.{nl}This is a situation where a human is involved in both Goddess and demon history. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002047	{nl}But, sadly, it will not be recorded.{nl}Neringa has destroyed all records of your involvement.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002048	Vaivora has sensed that something has gone wrong.{nl}She believed all to be finished.{nl}But right now there is no reason to care about her. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002049	{nl}Neringa will head towards Valandis Room 91 first.{nl}I will inform Vaivora that the plan has failed.{nl}Then you must come straight to Valandis Room 91.{nl}Neringa will wait for you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002050	How did it turn out like this?{nl}The device isn't responding.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002051	You've failed me.{nl}Now I see the human limits.{nl}I was stupid...{nl}But it's not your fault.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002052	It was my fault for giving such an important task to a human.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002053	I...{nl}The next plan is...{nl}To stop Giltine I could...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002054	Everywhere has become polluted and ruined by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}Vaivora, before she destroys everything, us included, you must take action.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002055	At this point...{nl}All we can do is collapse the Fantasy Library and trap Giltine...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002056	It's no use.{nl}There is a no way a human can complete against a Demon Goddess...{nl}However, a human chosen by Laima may be different.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002057	{nl}I wish not to put you harm's way.{nl}But I need you to buy us some time until the Kupole and I can figure out how to trap Giltine.{nl}Right now, this is our best plan...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002058	Demon Goddess Giltine is summoning her demons to Valandis Room 91.{nl}Neringa is sure she is residing there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002059	{nl}You need to stop Giltine before she gets her hands on the revelation and escapes.{nl}To do this you must destroy the dimensional doors used to summon the demons.{nl}Then, you and Neringa will need to prepare a way to keep you safe from Giltine.{nl}But first, destroy the doors.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002060	This incident is coming to and end just as the Goddess predicted.{nl}And your role has become more important.{nl}Neringa will make the necessary preparations and, during this time,{nl}destroy as many Dimensional Doors as possible.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002061	We have almost reached where Demon Goddess Giltine is residing.{nl}Nearby is the revelation Goddess Laima prepared for Giltine.{nl}Giltine has already burned her way through the library to reach that one revelation.{nl}And Goddess Laima has said that you also must be there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002062	{nl}Stay near Neringa.{nl}Neringa will keep you safe.{nl}But you must also keep Neringa safe from the demon minions.{nl}Now let us follow Giltine. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002063	{nl}Now we only need to follow Giltine.{nl}Stay close. If you get too far away from Neringa, you will be struck by Giltine's power. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002064	The time has come to end this.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002065	Goddess Laima spoke of a day where Giltine's black wings will be broken.{nl}But this is not that day.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002066	{nl}From here forward, you will face Giltine alone.{nl}Neringa did not appear in the final scene of Goddess Laima's prediction.{nl}Under the black wing's shadow is the future.{nl}Suppress your fear and continue forward.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002067	Fate, itself, will protect you.{nl}Go forth.{nl}You are the Revelator. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002068	You have successfully fulfilled Goddess Laima's prediction.{nl}Then, Neringa's role here is done.{nl}But the journey for you has not come to an end.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002069	Now that this is over, Goddess Laima wishes to guide you to Astral Tower.{nl}At the tower will be a revelation for you to find.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002070	At Astral Tower there will be new hardships and revelations waiting for you.{nl}However, all of this follows from Goddess Laima. You will be safe.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002071	Before leaving, report to Vaivora that the revelation was not retrieved.{nl}And that Neringa has also left.{nl}She will not ask you why.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002072	I see.. this is how things turned out..{nl}I appreciate your courage and sacrifice.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002073	This is the second time I have missed Giltine is my own library.{nl}It seems Laima and my sisters will berate me for this...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002074	I knew that Neringa would leave eventually.{nl}She was always around but her presence was never imposing.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002075	If we ever meet again, there is much I want to ask.{nl}But it will have to wait until the world is freed from Giltine's grasp.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002076	Once again thank you for your sacrifice.{nl}And my apologies.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002077	Please take this with you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002078	This power was something given to me by Laima through Neringa.{nl}And it was Neringa who told me to pass this on to you, once everything was finished.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002079	Resistor Skirgaila
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002080	I'm sorry to suddenly stop you, but could you lend me a hand.{nl}We, as part of the resistance, are doing recon in this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002081	But as were going about this task, the Beholder came and kidnapped our Lieutenant.{nl}There is no one else who can help.Please, please rescue our Lieutenant..
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002082	Sorry, I'm really sorry.If we were more focused, this never would have happened..{nl}To push this request on you so suddenly..but a person's life hangs in the balance. Please, I beg you. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002083	Our relationship is in the gutter, but I'm willing to make a deal with you here.{nl}And of course, our intentions are none of your concern.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002084	But you want to save the so-called Lieutenant, and I want to make a simple deal with you that involves Demon Lord Solcomm.{nl}Think before answering. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002085	Alright, here it is. Nearby, Solcomm has installed a Crystal Stone to supply himself with magic power.{nl}Your task is to use this Orb to absorb the magic from the stone and return it to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002086	Oh, and I was told that the Crystal Stone is protected by something or another.{nl}You can just investigate that by yourself. You got this, right?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002087	Alright, good.The Crystal Stone we need to work on is the one in Prieblanda Rest Place.{nl}There are pillars near the stone, so maybe that's the defense systems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002088	If you activate them in order, the defense field rotating around the crystal will disappear. That will be your cue to absorb the energy.{nl}If you mess up, it won't be a huge problem. But it'll be incredibly annoying.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002089	You still haven't absorbed the Crystal Stone's energy, yet you show no fear. Why is that?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002090	I'll say it again. Activate each of the pillars in Prieblanda Rest Place in order and when the defense field disappears,{nl}absorb the energy from the Crystal Stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002091	There will come a time where you will need my help. Alright, let's move on.{nl}Did you really think doing one task would be enough? Of course not.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002092	The Crystal Stone I knew the most about was the one in Prieblanda. I only know the location of the others.{nl}The next one is at Lemtis Lot. I'll leave investigating the defense systems and absorbing the magic to you. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002093	Why do I want to get rid of Solcomm?{nl}Do you really think that I, the bearer of concepts that existed before humans, will share them with someone such as yourself?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002094	Looks like you succeeded again. Yet, I'm getting a suspicious vibe.{nl}Hm, well, right now the Crystal Stones are most important.{nl}Let's move on. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002095	The next Crystal Stone is in Zibukas Crossroad.{nl}Go ahead first to investigate and I'll follow soon after. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002096	You would think that guy would have appeared by now...Of course, the intelligence was correct.{nl}Don't question things you haven't heard. Now stop staring and let's go.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002097	You sense a strange energy around the Crystal?{nl}It seems that Crystal Stone is protected by a different type of magic. You'll just have to neutralize its effects.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002098	I gave you a magic nullifying tool, no? The time has come for you to use it.{nl}Right now it has no power, but defeat a few of Solcomm's minions and monsters and fill it up with their spirits. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002099	Fill the tool magic by defeating the monsters and Solcomm's minions in the area.{nl}When it's fully charged, go and remove the magic around the Crystal Stone. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002100	And like that, the Stone in this area has been handled...But still...{nl}There should have been some sort of appearance when that human broke the first Crystal Stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002101	Are you acting more cautious than before, or are you scared?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002102	The human I brought along ended up breaking the Crystal Stone that was here.{nl}Trying to make my life difficult, I see.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002103	But despite all this, Solcomm has yet to appear.{nl}And now that I think about it, outside Zibukas Crossroad hasn't been checked. I'll have to inspect there as well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002104	If Solcomm isn't found, then this whole process has been meaningless.{nl}This doesn't bode well for you either. Go check the location I mentioned.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002105	Since there was a trap in place, there was no use. That's how he kept his Demon Lord status. Pretty arrogant, no?{nl}One can understand F'vetta's interest. Anyway, since there was a trap there, that means he's in this area. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002106	Well, even if it's not necessarily a trap, I think Solcomm is hiding in this area looking for his chance.{nl}Don't be a chicken. Look carefully and smoke him out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002107	It's disappointing that Solcomm escaped this time, but he won't be free of me so easily.{nl}There are very few places where he can run off too, so it's only a matter of time. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002108	I'm completely grateful that you completed my request, despite its unreasonableness.{nl}And now I know it's shameless to ask you for another, but I do have a favor to ask.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002109	Our task here is to do recon on the area but certain circumstances have made it difficult.{nl}I trust your strength and I ask for your help. With it, we can safely complete our work here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002110	Really thank you! The first task is to burn the demon's supply chests.{nl}Before you arrived, I had investigated the area and found a few of them here and there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002111	The supplies have yet to be arranged.{nl}We cannot miss this opportunity to cause some confusion. I'll provide the materials needed to start a fire, so please help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002112	What's happening here... It was quite a lucky chance to come here and see Solcomm's movements.{nl}And the Crystal Stone to be broken... the Lieutenant should have been more careful...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002113	Thank you. The demons will also face some confusion over their disappearing supplies.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002114	Seeing as how strong you are, I hope that you can help with another task.{nl}Zibukas Crossroad is always overrun with demons that it makes recon incredibly difficult.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002115	What I'm saying is: our information is a bit outdated. Please take this Parchment and{nl}record the overall layout of the area in that direction. Would this be possible?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002116	For a long time we have been unable to investigate Zibukas Crossroad due to the number of demons.{nl}The resistance would greatly benefit from your help in this matter. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002117	Thanks to you we can finally update our information.{nl}This will surely help the resistance's future plans. Thank you very much. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002118	You mentioned some wagons in the record you wrote. The demons must be using them to move their supplies.{nl}I'll give you the tools necessary to burn down those wagons. Then, the demons will also face some hardships.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002119	If it wasn't for you, we would have missed these small details.{nl}The information you have recorded for us, will help the resistance.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002120	Well done! For the time being, the supply line to this direction has been cut.{nl}You did us a great favor. Really, thank you so much!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002121	Thanks to you, our task has become a bit easier but those demons still weigh on my mind...{nl}To help our recon work run more smoothly, could you please get rid of the demons in the area?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002122	I am forever indebted to you. And I'm sure the Goddess will also hear of the work you have done for us
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002123	Just amazing! Work will go on a bit more smoothly now.{nl}Of course, completely eliminating the demons will be difficult, but you are free to try.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002124	Resistor Abraomas
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002125	If it's okay with you, I have a small request. Actually a new recruit who went looking for the Lieutenant went missing.{nl}I went searching for him myself but its a bit hard for me to keep moving.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002126	Any kind of information would be good..{nl}In this vicinity, if you find a clue about the new recruit will you please inform me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002127	Please... let him be safe. I worry so much. He is full of guts but has so much to learn...Hah.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002128	T-This...belonged to out new recruit! Then this means something did happen.{nl} Ohhh...if only he was more careful...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002129	If... he's really gone... M-maybe across there...? But that would be dangerous!{nl}The number of demons there... I'm sorry but could you please go across there and look for him?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002130	Thank you. I want to go myself but... as you can see, Officer Skirgaila said it is dangerous...{nl}Please go in my stead...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002131	Any kind of trace of him would be good. No matter what you come across, please tell me.{nl}This person is very important to me...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002132	That... belonged to him. That was the extra dragger he carried with him.{nl}Ohh, after gathering all these clues, is it still okay to believe he is still alive?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002133	The last place is Lanko 22 Waters.. that's the demon's post. Which makes me more worried.{nl}Could you please check this final location? Ah, his name 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002134	Leonardas
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002135	Leonardas.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002136	Although we are not blood relatives, this recruit is like a brother to me.{nl}He always looked up to me and followed me into the army...If he disappears I...Ohhh...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002137	Resistor Leonardas
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002138	Wh-Who are you? You? Abraomas asked you to come find me? Ha, haha...thank you.{nl}I really though...I would die...really...I've caused so much trouble...Ah, again, thank you for coming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002139	I have something to do so, you, go to Lanko 22 Waters. Find Solcomm and kill him.{nl}If you try to pull anything funny, just remember that I have the person you're looking for. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002140	...You've arrived. You've received a request from the Beholder to kill me, no?{nl}Before you do, I have a question. What did the Beholder say about me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002141	So that's what he thinks... and you are forced to work with him. I understand everything now.{nl}I'll tell you this. The energy that the Beholder has asked you to gather is not mine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002142	The true purpose of the Crystal Stones is to record information about the area. In other words, what you collected was information.{nl}Now image if this fell into the Beholder's hands..Where will he use it, I wonder.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002143	You understand quickly. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002144	Killing me
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002145	was the request, but there was none for destroying the Crystal Stone.{nl}That's the key. I would recommend interrupting his little plan by destroying them.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002146	I wouldn't say anything bad to a person who was taken advantage of. Now, tell me your thoughts.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002147	Your task is to destroy the two Crystal Stones here and the remaining ones in Lanko 26 Waters.{nl}The ones here and the ones there are connected so using the self-destruction device will work fine. It won't be dangerous.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002148	Start with the ones over here. Negilus Inner Court is the closest so check that Crystal Stone first.{nl}The security devices are running, so destroy them all. If you do, the Crystal Stone will follow.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002149	Not only that one, but other Crystal Stones are protected in various ways.{nl}This is protect the records from others. What? This information isn't exclusive. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002150	Well... you can also see it from your view.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002151	Hm... fascinating. Next, the Crystal Stone in the garden.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002152	The Stone in the garden is protected by magic, just like the ones you saw in the crossroads in Lanko 26 Waters.{nl}The easiest way to destroy it is to use a bomb that can penetrate and remove magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002153	You will have to make this bomb yourself. Here is the recipe and the materials.{nl} The rest are roots that you will have to gather from Lily Velly and Jelly Velly. Once the bomb is made, use it to destroy the Crystal Stone.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002154	Until now the Beholder has only sent his minions and has not appeared himself.{nl}What is he planning...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002155	Very good. Now to address the Crystal Stone in Lanko 26 Waters.{nl}We can overlook what type of plan he is devising, but we cannot allow the Beholder to have his way.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002156	The self-destruction device is hidden between the rocks in Dregnas Lot. Find it and activate it.{nl}But it will take some time, so I recommend keeping a lookout.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002157	Based on what you told me, I've realized that changing the Beholder's mind won't be possible.{nl}Instead, I'm going to thwart his plans. This is the conclusion I've come to.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002158	Now all of the Crystal Stone's are gone. The Beholder must be pulling hairs since his plan had been interrupted.{nl}And he will be on his way. Before all is revealed, I have another request for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002159	This request may be difficult for you to accept.{nl}But if you think of your future, this could be profitable. What do you think? Here me out.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002160	Although the result was different from intended, it was acceptable.{nl}I've already returned the Lieutenant you were looking for.He's possibly on his way back to the other resistance members by now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002161	Well then, we'll part ways here. Stay alive, at least until we meet again.{nl}That will be my reward, no?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002162	I would like to return, but I've hurt myself here and there, making it hard for me to move.{nl}Would you mind lending me a hand?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002163	Thank you. Could you collect the materials I need?{nl}First you need to water the Lily Velly and Jelly Velly that live here with lake water and then gather their leaves.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002164	Have you heard? The water from Star Struck Lake Water is fatal to demons.{nl}What I'm making now will not be as effective, but I'm trying to make it as close to the level of Star Struck Lake as I can.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002165	Thank you. Now let's move on to the next stage.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002166	I'm trying to craft magical sap that has the effect of Star Struck Lake. However, we need something more than just the leaf.{nl}There are catalysts that promote magical reactions in the demons' storage nearby. Could you bring those to me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002167	I found that storage in the past while trying to hide from demons.{nl}After going inside, I found a box, and saw the catalyst inside. I wanted to make something like this with the catalyst ever since.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002168	Thank you! All that's left to do is to make the sap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002169	We're almost done! Can you craft some sap with the ingredients and the bottle I gave you?{nl}Here is the recipe for the sap. I'm sure you're much better at doing things like this than I am...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002170	I really hope this works like I hope it does. Everyone must be worried sick about me.{nl}I've even disobeyed orders to come here??I know I'll be in trouble, but I still want to go back soon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002171	You're back! We'll be done after testing this sap on a demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002172	Here is a bottle of the sap we've made. Find a demon to test this on.{nl}If it works, you'll see its effects immediately. After that, please make sure to deal with the affected demon.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002173	How did it go? Did you have any trouble dealing with the demons?{nl}This is the first time I've actually made the sap, so I hope it worked.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002174	Thank you! I think I've mostly recovered while you were making the sap.{nl}All I have to do now is go back with the sap!
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002175	Wait! I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to get back to my friends. However, I'm hurt...{nl}If you can, will you get rid of the demons around here to help me get back to my friends?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002176	There are lots of demons scattered around the way back to my friends.{nl}Would you get rid of these demons for me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002177	Everyone must be worried about me... I disobeyed orders to find my lieutenant...{nl}I hope Adjutant General and everyone else is okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002178	Thank you. There are still some demons left in the area, but the situation has gotten much better.{nl}If possible, come back anytime to help me a bit more.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002179	This is troubling... I guess when it rains, it pours...{nl}Hey! Here! Ahh... Never mind. Sorry to bother you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002180	My heart goes to you for helping us.{nl}Without you, we would still be regretting what we've done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002181	Ah, it's you. Welcome. I've just heard that our lieutenant has returned. I truly appreciate your help!{nl}For now, we'll stay here a bit longer to assess the situation. We still need to carry on with our mission.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002182	I should have stopped him when I had the chance... If I have, this would not have happened...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002183	Huh? Is Leonardas still alive? The goddess must be watching over us...{nl}Thank you! And thank the goddess...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002184	Leonardas is getting ready to come back? With his injuries? Oh, goodness...{nl}We need to do something to help him. Thank you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002185	Is there anything left to do? If you're worried about what I'm doing,{nl}don't bother. You wouldn't even understand. Just keep walking.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002186	Ughh... I need to go back... But my legs won't move the way I want... I hope everyone is okay...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002187	I need to go back to my comrades as soon as I can, but my injuries...{nl}Will you please help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002188	Thanks to you, I feel much better. I better get going.{nl}I've come this far, so I'll remain here for a bit to record the area. Thanks for your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002189	All right. I'll be brief and to the point.
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002190	Ugh... Monsters took off with our supplies.{nl}We were preoccupied with demons...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002191	We need to repair the altar...{nl}No one expected demons to come here and destroy the altar...
QUEST_LV_0400_20171128_002192	Following Jurate's words is becoming harder and harder.

QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002877	This is Goddess Vaivora's Fantasy Library, which has on record all of the world's knowledge and history.{nl}In this place, you can only view the information meant for you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002878	You will not be able to see the books that are not.{nl}This place has history and wisdom about humanity that even the Goddesses themselves do not know about.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002879	In the far future, when you are ready to learn of it, you will be able to view it too.{nl}But now is not that time. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002880	Neringa knew you would accept the invitation.{nl}And there is much that needs to be said.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002881	You and Neringa will go together to Goddess Vaivora's domain.{nl}Humans are meant to approach the location primarily by invitation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002882	But this is still not the case.{nl}There is something you need to know.{nl}Starting from Neringa...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002883	Revelator, you must have some concerns about this current situation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002884	Neringa will convey Goddess Laima's will to you.{nl}Yet only at the times deemed right.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002885	Together with Neringa, you will go to Fantasy Library.{nl}There you will meet with Goddess Vaivora and her Kupole helper.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002886	They will not welcome a human to the Fantasy Library.{nl}Please do not forget. Neringa recommended you for an invitation.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002887	You are here because Neringa helped you to gain the Goddess' trust.{nl}Please continue to build her trust in you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002888	Focus on listening to her and completing her requests.{nl}Neringa will go first and wait for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002889	So, you are the Revelator.{nl}I have heard about you from Neringa.{nl}Where you come from and where you are being pulled towards... I have heard it all.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002890	Yet, I still have reservations about Neringa's judgement in inviting you here.{nl}I assume you have already heard from Neringa what it that we do.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002891	I asked Neringa as well. What can a human do for us here?{nl}You will have to prove yourself through sacrifice to answer that question.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002892	I strive to prevent humans like you from interrupting the Goddesses' work.{nl}Go help Neringa.{nl}That is something you can do.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002893	As you can see, at the moment there is no opportunity for you to join Goddess Vaivora's plans.{nl}So, solve her smaller issues to gain her trust.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002894	The defensive system in Sausys Room 9 is weak, allowing demons to trespass easily.{nl}But Goddess Vaivora's Kupole cannot stop them alone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002895	It would be good to take her place.{nl}Defeat a few of the demons and you will gain a lot Her trust.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002896	Your ability is already known.{nl}How much you can do is also already known.{nl}Meaning, what you need to know is already known.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002897	You did well.{nl}Right now Goddess Vaivora is in Valandis Room 2 preparing a trap to capture Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002898	She thinks that Giltine wants to get her hands on the book that's about her.{nl}It's not proper work for a goddess, but Giltine won't fall for just any trap.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002899	You will have to work hard to gain Goddess Vaivora's trust.{nl}But the time, and the work that you have to do, has already been decided.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002900	Set your mind towards protecting the Goddess' very precious records.{nl}Everywhere is flooded with demons destroying them.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002901	Please go and collect these scattered records.{nl}Doing something as simple as this will surely attract the Goddess' attention.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002902	Doing this much will draw the Goddess' attention.{nl}Goddess Vaivora believes that if Giltine is removed everything will be solved.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002903	This means isolating her from the rest of the world.{nl}But everything that happens is influenced by the Devine Tree itself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002904	Even if Demon Goddess Giltine disappears other, more uncontrollable versions of her will take her place.{nl}Sadly, Goddess Vaivora does not have faith in Goddess Laima's prediction.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002905	She also does not have faith in you, who was selected by Laima.{nl}Therefore, here, together with the hand of faith, you must match Goddess Lamia's prediction.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002906	Kupole Rugile is alone in Sausys Room 9 dealing with the demons.{nl}Despite being Vaivora's Kupole, she will not be able to handle them all alone.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002907	You must help Kupole Rugile.{nl}However, Vaivora's Kupole will be weary of you since you are a human.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002908	Before approaching her, remove the Kupole trap set by the demons.{nl}Kupole Rugile will show interest in you after this. And, of course, this interest will be conveyed to Goddess Vaivora.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002909	You are the human Neringa invited.{nl}There is something a human can do to help us...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002910	You seem strong enough and ready to serve the goddess.{nl}If there is no other place you must be, can you help me?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002911	It's a difficult situation.{nl}Vaivora and I sealed off all of the passages used by the demons.{nl}But how are they still able to enter?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002912	Certainly, by someone's help they are entering.{nl}This scroll can detect the small gaps in which the demons are using to invade.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002913	With this scroll, find the point of invasion and remove it.{nl}I will not be able to hold out for long if this continues.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002914	This place has been run by Goddess Vaivora and the Kupoles for a long time.{nl}This place is unbeknownst even to the followers of Vaivora.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002915	It's more than just a few demons that have entered.{nl}And they are ruining the library.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002916	I do not know what it is they seek, but I cannot allow them to touch the records at will.{nl}Please get rid of the demons you see in the area.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002917	Possibly the records of the great and unnamed kings have already disappeared. {nl}As time passes, so will more and more records.{nl}Please stop the demons.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002918	Thank you so much.{nl}Thanks to you we can protect the records that are under our care.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002919	After seeing your actions here, it seems you would be an even greater help to the Goddess.{nl}We will tell the Goddess of your courage and sacrifice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002920	Now return to Neringa and tell her of your accomplishment.{nl}And, by all means, please use your power in correct place.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002921	You have returned.{nl}The news of you helping Rugile has been passed on to Goddess Vaivora.{nl}We can now move on to the next stage.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002922	You with Neringa will meet someone you have had a long ill-fated relationship with.{nl}Let's go to Sausys Room 10.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002923	You are the first to be invited here.{nl}In the past, there was commotion because of those who were not invited.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002924	Slowly more and more demons are invading.{nl}It's hard for me to figure out alone how they are coming here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002925	I've done all I've could but it's not enough.{nl}However, if you can help me, I will be able to gather some time.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002926	Suspicious magic gathering demons have been found.{nl}If you can defeat them, it will decrease the number of demons coming this way.{nl}Please do this for us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002927	Although I know a great scale of the Fantasy Library, there are thousands of areas.{nl}If the demons enter through another location this will cause huge problems.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002928	At least I have one less nuisance to deal with.{nl}I appreciate your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002929	The invading demons are damaging the books.{nl}They do not hesitate with their meaningless plundering.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002930	Maybe their leader said to destroy whatever they could get their hands on.{nl}If you want to help the Goddess don't allow them to run away with the records.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002931	Please recover the unidentified records that the demons stole.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002932	We still have not found a place for all that is contained in the Fantasy Library.{nl}The records that Vaivora and us, the Kupole, still need to classify are slowly coming in.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002933	I see the damaged records. Those demons...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002934	After this is done, Vaivora will punish those demons.{nl} Thank you for your help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002935	Everything have been decided.{nl}Even if you try to fight your destiny, the end will be the same.{nl}You are on the right track. You are doing well.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002936	Vaivora will help solve everything.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002937	Goddess Vaivora has almost completed her plan.{nl}But we cannot have the Beholder interfere.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002938	Your work here should stand out.{nl}Therefore, Vaivora will have a request for you in the next District.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002939	This place is overrun with the Beholder's plans.{nl}Everywhere the Kupole are falling into its traps and getting into trouble.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002940	We must rid Sausys Room 10 of the Beholder's shadow.{nl}Destroy the first corrupted crystal.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002941	If you leave the corrupted crystal alone, the Beholder and the demons will continue to harass the Kupole.{nl}And, remember, the fact that Neringa is here must not be revealed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002942	The Beholder thinks the situation will go according to plan.{nl}But everything will go as predicted. Focus on your role.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002943	Destroying that many will be enough.{nl}It will be troublesome if the Beholder becomes aware of us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002944	Destroying the corrupted crystals made the plan smoother.{nl}Kupole Saya is dealing with the invading demons here.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002945	But there were so many, she went into hiding to replenish her energy.{nl}You will present a good impression if you defeat the demons that are near her.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002946	Defeat the demons and then go to Kupole Saya.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002947	There is no better way. Follow the chosen path.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002948	You are the human traveling with Neringa.{nl}I'm surprised that a human can defeat these demons.{nl}You could be a powerful asset to Vaivora.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002949	As the demons invaded they destroyed most of the protection crystals.{nl}If they are not restored the demons will treat this place like their house.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002950	If you want to help Vaivora, first help to restore the protection crystals.{nl}The protection crystals were shattered into Trasium Pieces, please collect as many Trasium Pieces as possible and return to me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002951	I do not know how far you will accomplish, but I will not refuse you even if you fail.{nl}Whereever you go, you are still just a human.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002952	I'm surprised. You have completely changed my thoughts about humans.{nl}Have all humans become as strong as you?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002953	While you were away Neringa contacted me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002954	I told her about your skillfulness.{nl}But Neringa's thinking seems a little different.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002955	You did well. Saya has praised you.{nl}Now there is only one more Kupole to save.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002956	I'm planning to collect Trasium Pieces in order to restore the protection crystals.{nl}I hope we can use your strength when the time comes.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002957	The Beholder has installed a magic prison to keep the Kupole.{nl}Goddess Vaivora's main helper, Kupole Ouida is here as well.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002958	If you save her, Goddess Vaivora's expectations of you will rise.{nl}Destroy the magic prison and save Kupole Ouida.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002959	She will then have a request for you.{nl}After that we will meet the Beholder.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002960	I trust and follow you in accordance with the prediction.{nl}Refrain from unnecessary actions and concentrate on your role.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002961	And you are?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002962	A human... I thought I would be saved by Vaivora...{nl}It's not what I expected but thank you for rescuing me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002963	The Beholder has installed magical prisons everywhere.{nl}The Kupole are in a state of confusion allowing the Beholder to rummage through the library.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002964	But we cannot allow this to continue.{nl}Will you allow them to roam around Vaivora's library? Open your eyes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002965	The reason they can roam here is because the protection crystals were destroyed.{nl}The remaining one is being attacked by the demons now.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002966	Ride this transportation device to the crystal.{nl}Defeat them all with your power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002967	You do not need to return to Ouida.{nl}Time is short. We must go to Goddess Vaivora after facing him.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002968	The Beholder must be growing aware that their plan is falling apart.{nl}Soon the Beholder will be here. Are you ready?
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002969	The Beholder follows Demon Goddess Giltine but shows no interest in her safety.{nl}He will leave soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002970	With Neringa, you will need to go to Valandis Room 2.{nl}When you are ready, follow. Neringa will go first and wait for you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002971	The Beholder still does not know you and Neringa are here.{nl}Neringa will stay out of the way until the Beholder thinks the task is done.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002972	If Neringa is discovered here, Giltine will be alerted.{nl}Now we have to let them destroy the Fantasy Library.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002973	Why did they come here at this time?{nl}This is troublesome.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002974	Talk of you helping Vaivora's Kupoles is circulating amongst them.{nl}Goddess Vaivora will come to look for you soon.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002975	She will trust you and tell you her plans.{nl}But you and Neringa's plans differ from the Goddess Vaivora's.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002976	Don't forget this. Listen politely to all the Goddess has to say.{nl}Goddess is coming.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002977	In fact, Goddess Vaivora has more conviction than Neringa thought.{nl} Neringa will need to execute this plan more precisely.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002978	Kupole Litae and Danute are in charge of this area.{nl}Kupole Litae will still be unsure about you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002979	But defeat the demons and she will come to your way.{nl}Please listen to her request. For Neringa's role, Neringa will leave first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002980	I can't believe you came here, but even more so, I can't believe your skills.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002981	I've heard of your courage and sacrifice from the other Kupole.{nl}Thank you very much for coming to help me.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002982	You've arrived. Did Kupole Litae greet you well?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002983	The Kupole are also different in their thinking and personalities.{nl}Some listen better than others.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002984	{nl}Goddess Vaivora will come to find you again.{nl}But before that, there is something you need to prepare.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002985	You and Neringa will face Giltine in Valandis Room 91.{nl}The Demon God can take your life with just one finger.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002986	So please find the item Nobraenal Blueprint so that Neringa may use that to protect you.{nl}With Neringa's divine energy and that item I will be able to hold back her power.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002987	Unfortunately, Goddess Laima cannot protect you.{nl}However, Neringa will tell you how to protect yourself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002988	Believe Neringa and follow what Neringa says.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002989	That should be enough.{nl}Neringa will tell you when it is time to use it.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002990	Now go to Goddess Vaivora.{nl}There are still parts Neringa needs to prepare for the plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002991	Your help is making the final preparations much easier.{nl}Now, please help us one last time. 
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002992	I must leave this place to examine Giltine's actions more closely.{nl}Kupole Danute is coming so please lend a hand. I hope that you help her.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002993	As Vaivora predicted, the demons are gathering her to make it easier for Giltine to enter.{nl}There is no time to waste so I must ask you for two items.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002994	The first is Dimensional Essense. That will be easy to find around here.{nl}The last one will be a problem...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002995	Defeat the demons and gather their magic source.{nl}After collecting both, come back here.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002996	The protection crystals are under attack!{nl}Since all of the library's energy is directed towards the trap, there is only one protection crystal guarding this area.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002997	If the protection crystals are not working, Giltine will still be able to escape even if we seal her within our trap.{nl}Take this tool and until the protection crystals are recharged fight off the demons!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002998	Thank you! And Neringa has returned as well.{nl}I will go and help with Vaivora's seal.  I'm grateful for your help!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_002999	Vaivora has finished her seal for Giltine.{nl}Unfortunately, Giltine will not appear this time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003000	Please remain calm and do as Vaivora instructed.{nl}Come back to Neringa when the work there is done.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003001	Neringa is preparing for the next plan.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003002	That is a record. Neringa will give it back to Vaivora.{nl}Right now you must deal with the embarrassed Goddess of Knowledge.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003003	Goddess Vaivora know much more than you or Neringa, expect for the future.{nl}Therefore it is impossible to convince Vaivora.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003004	Vaivora will now make an extreme choice.{nl}Give up the revelation and remove Giltine from this world.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003005	She still thinks that is correct.{nl}In the meantime, let's move to Valandis Room 3.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003006	There you and Neringa will listen to the Goddess plans and follow.{nl}Neringa will go first.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003007	Goddess Vaivora has instructed you to collect all the magical energy that can be used on the alter for the seal.{nl}There are devices around the library that you can collect the magic from.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003008	Please activate them.{nl}The activated magic devices will go where they are needed.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003009	There was a human who came here without an invitation.{nl}But you are the first to be formally invited.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003010	That looks like enough.{nl}Also, Neringa is looking for you. It would be good if you go.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003011	I will finish the rest of the work here.{nl} I will be off.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003012	I'm surprised by your work. Human potential seems to know no bounds.{nl}To play a part in continuing human history, I will tell you something.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003013	Several hundred years ago, Demon Goddess Giltine had already invaded this place.{nl}She was looking for a record of herself.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003014	But at the time she could not obtain it.{nl}So she comes again today.{nl}I do not know where she will use it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003015	But she is coming to this place soon to get her hands on that record.{nl}We have taken advantage of her greed by preparing a trap.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003016	As she becomes overcome with joy for finally getting her hands on the record, she will disappear from this world.{nl}If she disappears from this world, every problem will be solved.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003017	All of the Goddesses will return to their rightful places and you too may go home.{nl}For this I need you help.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003018	My Kupole are in the final stages of perfecting the trap.{nl}Please help them. I also have last minute preparations.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003019	Once again, thank you for your courage and you sacrifice.{nl}For the sake of the world, please endure just a little bit longer.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003020	Please collect them quickly!
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003021	Kupole Danute is still unfocused. This may be a handful for a human such as yourself.{nl}But if you have nothing else to do...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003022	Vaivora wants to destroy a part of the Fantasy Library in order to block future entry.{nl}But it will not go according to the Goddess' wish.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003023	It's quite unfortunate... To ensure that the prediction comes true, you must artfully disrupt the Goddess' plan.{nl}And Goddess must not know what you and Neringa are the ones to blame.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003024	So follow the Goddess' plan for awhile.{nl}When it is time to execute our own plan, Neringa will call you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003025	To sacrifice a part of the district to capture Giltine.{nl}Vaivora's plan seems reckless.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003026	Vaivora will ask you to activate the sealing device set up in Valandis Room 3.{nl}Go about the task.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003027	Neringa will also do as such.{nl}Go to Vaivora.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003028	Neringa will call you when it is time.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003029	Time is running out and there are not many Kupoles remaining that I can call...{nl}You will be able to help me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003030	Here Skywa is helping me to operate the Bluenode Collapsing Device.{nl}But the energy from this device is calling demons to it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003031	Please go there and protect the device for me.{nl}If we lose even one, Giltine will slip away.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003032	It hurts me as well to make such a decision.{nl}And I will bear this crime for eternity.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003033	But to save the world from Giltine's grip...{nl}It's an expensive sacrifice that must be done.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003034	Amazing!{nl}The activated collapsing device will conceal its magic, and will not face attack again.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003035	Now Skywa will activate the collapsing device remotely.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003036	Next we need to activate the second collapsing device.{nl}However, it does not have enough energy to run.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003037	Gather the Gigantic magic source around the area of the second collapsing device.{nl}After that, listen to Meringa about what to do next.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003038	I will return after surveilling Valandis Room 91.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003039	I will not be gone long.{nl}However, while I am away please consult Neringa if you need help.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003040	Our goal is to cause the Blanorth collapsing device to overload.{nl}Until then we will continue to follow Vaivora's plan, so as to not alert suspicion.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003041	Kupole Skywa is walking around and managing the collapsing devices.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003042	Operating them is simple enough. Insert the Gigantic magic source that you have in your possession into the device.{nl}As the device re-energizes, protect it until it can conceal its magic.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003043	Right now the Goddess is checking on Demon Goddess Giltine's rampage in Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003044	As pressing as the matter is, the Goddess will not use the Fantasy Library as a burial ground for Giltine.{nl}Please follow the plan thoughtfully and reliably.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003045	You have successfully energized the device.{nl}It's good to know the plan is right on schedule.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003046	Giltine is currently in Valandis Room 91 searching frankly for the revelation.{nl}Let us finally finish the task before us.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003047	Now, there are only a few devices left to run.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003048	But is there enough time to leave everything to Skywa... And it would be difficult to protect.{nl}Would you be willing to help Skywa?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003049	Make you way to Ballandans collapsing device.{nl}Skywa will be waiting for you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003050	The human helping Vaivora is you?{nl}This is my first time seeing one, but you seem particularly strong.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003051	I have a job for you...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003052	Not too long ago, I set the Ballandans Collapsing Device.{nl}I was going activate another devicce here as well, but the demons swarmed me.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003053	If I waste my time on them, I won't be able to finish the work Vaivora gave me.{nl}How about clearing demons from around the Ballandans collapsing device?{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003054	You just need to protect it until the device is set and conseals itself...{nl}While you deal with this, I'll be able to go and finish my other remaining tasks.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003055	Thank you so much! Humans are so kind, no?{nl}Alright, I'm going to go finish my other preparations. I'm counting on you.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003056	Your help is appreciated. Thanks to you, Skywa was able to complete the rest of the preparations.{nl}Now only Balanorth collapsing device is left.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003057	Shall I give this remaining task to you?{nl}When all is ready, just turn on the device.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003058	Oh, right Neringa was looking for you. It seems she also needs your help.{nl}I'll wait here for your successful return.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003059	Everything has been prepared.{nl}And Vaivora has no reason to distrust you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003060	You received the request to handle the Balanorth collapsing device, no?{nl}When go to run that device, the head monsters will appear and interrupt you.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003061	When the head monsters are defeated they will release great amounts of energy.{nl}We will use that.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003062	Please lure the head monsters closer to the Balanorth device and defeat them there.{nl}Their released energy will overheat the device and destroy it.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003063	Then Vaivora's mission will fail in its final step.{nl}Once you have completed this task, you and Neringa will go together to Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003064	Please do not forget.{nl}You must defeat the head monsters when they are nearest to the device.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003065	All of history is recorded in Fantasy Library. Of course, records about you are also here.{nl}This is a situation where a human is involved in both Goddess and demon history.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003066	But, sadly, it will not be recorded.{nl}Neringa has destroyed all records of your involvement.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003067	Vaivora has sensed that something has gone wrong.{nl}She believed all to be finished.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003068	But right now there is no reason to care about her.{nl}Neringa will head towards Valandis Room 91 first.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003069	Inform Vaivora that the plan has failed.{nl}Then you must come straight to Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003070	Neringa will wait for you there.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003071	How did it turn out like this?{nl}The device isn't responding.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003072	You've failed me.{nl}Now I see the human limit.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003073	I was stupid...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003074	But it's not your fault.{nl}It was my fault for giving such an important task to a human.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003075	I...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003076	The Next plan is...{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003077	To stop Giltine I could...
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003078	Everywhere has become polluted and ruined by Demon Goddess Giltine.{nl}Vaivora, before she destroys everything, us included, you must take action.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003079	It's no use.{nl}There is no way a human can compete against a Demon God..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003080	However, a human chosen by Laima may be different.{nl}I wish not to put you harm's way.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003081	But I need you to buy us some time until the Kupole and I can figure out how to trap Giltine.{nl}Right now, this is our best plan..
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003082	Demon Goddess Giltine is summoning her demons to Valandis Room 91.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003083	Neringa is sure she is residing there.{nl}You need to stop Giltine before she gets her hands on the revelation and escapes.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003084	To do this you must destroy the dimensional doors used to summon the demons.{nl}Then, you and Neringa will need to prepare a way to keep you safe from Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003085	But first, destroy the doors.{nl}This incident is coming to an end just as the Goddess predicted.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003086	And your role has become more important.{nl}Neringa will make the necessary preparations and, during this time, destroy as many dimensional doors as possible.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003087	We have almost reached where Demon God Giltine is residing.{nl}Nearby is the revelation Goddess Laima prepared for Giltine.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003088	Giltine has already burned her way through the library to reach that one revelation.{nl}And Goddess Laima has said that you also must be there.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003089	Stay near Neringa. Neringa will keep you safe.{nl}But you must also keep Neringa safe from the demon minions.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003090	Now let us follow Giltine.{nl}Now we only need to follow Giltine.{nl}Stay close. If you get too far away from Neringa, you will be struck by Giltine's power.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003091	Goddess Laima spoke of a day where Giltine's black wings will be broken.{nl}But this is not that day.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003092	From here forward, you will face Giltine alone.{nl}Neringa did not appear in the final scene of Goddess Laima's prediction.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003093	Under the black wing's shadow is the future.{nl}suppress your fear and continue forward.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003094	Fate, itself, will protect you.{nl}Go forth, Revelator.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003095	You have successfully fulfilled Goddess Laima's prediction.Then, Neringa's role here is done.{nl}But the journey for you has not come to an end.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003096	Now that this is over, Goddess Laima wished to guide you to Astral Tower.{nl}At the tower will be a revelation for you to find.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003097	At Astral Tower there will be new hardships and revelations waiting for you.{nl}However, all of this follows from Goddess Laima. You will be safe.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003098	Before leaving, report to Vaivora that the revelation was not retrieved.{nl}And that Neringa has also left.{nl}She will not ask you why.
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003099	I see.. this is how things turned out.{nl}I appreciate your courage and sacrifice.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003100	This is the second time I have missed Giltine in my own library.{nl}It seems Laima and my sisters will berate me for this..{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003101	I knew that Neringa would leave eventually.{nl}She was always around but her presence was never imposing.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003102	If we meet again, there is much I want to ask.{nl}But it will have to wait until the world is freed from Giltine's grasp.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003103	This power was something given to me by Laima through Neringa.{nl}And it was Neringa who told me to pass this on to you, once everything was finished.{nl}
QUEST_LV_0400_20180208_003104	I pray this will be useful to you.
