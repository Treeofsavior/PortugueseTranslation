ITEM_20151022_007276	Plague Doctor Helmet
ITEM_20151022_007277	Ever since the very first Paladin did, many people throughout the ages have guarded the Tenet Church. All those years of accumulated experience have been drawn upon to create this combination of power and convenience.
ITEM_20151022_007278	Most attempts at keeping plants in check with other plants after Medzio Diena have failed, but after the ability to drain the energy of plant monsters of a certain fern was discovered, it has been applied to weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007279	Equipment specialized against beast monsters have developed due to the environment of the Lucas Region. It is rare for a region to be as untouched by the Great Plant Cataclysm as Lucas, and this scarcity became the basis on which this equipment was produced.
ITEM_20151022_007280	It is uncommon for Kingdom fortresses to be built with wood or dirt. As such, it is a nuisance in strongly fortified regions when the stones or minerals that form castles become monsters and thus require effective weaponry when such incidents occur.
ITEM_20151022_007281	Agailla Flurry decided to leave one recipe in celebration of completing the epitaph. The recipe, which was all but forgotten for hundreds of years after her death, was only reevaluated after Medzio Diena. Only now the effectiveness of Flurry's recipe against insects is being highlighted.
ITEM_20151022_007282	The exact origins and creator of this weapon recipe are unknown. Some speculate that it was created by a nameless master, but most experts think that it was created incognito by someone famous due to certain circumstances.
ITEM_20151022_007283	One does not have to be a priest to embark on a pilgrimage. As long as they look up to the goddess and are on pilgrimage, it matters not if they are mage, archer, or of other professions. Of course, it helps if the weapon they are used to is threatening to demons.
ITEM_20151022_007284	In a certain period of history, the Istora region was famous as a retirement place for scholars. There was a temporary exchange of various academics in the region achieving new inventions and discoveries. The Istora Sword is one of those achievements.
ITEM_20151022_007285	The aim of the sacred pact centered around the Tenet Church is the eventual defeat of the Demon Queen. It is said that the creators of this sword prayed that it would be able to gravely wound the Demon Queen.
ITEM_20151022_007286	Magical application of the stealing energy from competing plants and secretion of harmful substances to weapons is a very difficult task. The fact that it succeeded in less than three years shows the urgency of the situation.
ITEM_20151022_007287	Regions with relatively less plant growth after Medzio Diena saw an increase in beast activity. This equipment is the result of such regional developments.
ITEM_20151022_007288	The stones and other material used to build the 3 layer castle wall near the capital rarely mutated into monsters. This was thanks to precautions against various catastrophies dating back to the founding of the kingdom. However, castles in other regions did not have such measures and now require weapons against monsters after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007289	Agailla Flurry devised a magical weapon that had two advantages in which a non-mage could use it and would exhibit it's true value after Medzio Diena. However, it is still uncertain if she foresaw Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007290	There is a theory that even those who like to throw wild guesses approach with caution. The theory that the original creator of the Krag Sword, based on the techniques applied and when it was first produced, is Ruklys.
ITEM_20151022_007291	Despite the goddesses interacting with humans in numerous places, it was only natural for the places where they had been or performed miracles to overlap or converge. The production and spreading of goods for those people was inevitable.
ITEM_20151022_007292	According to certain radicalists, Istora weapons are said to utilize source energy of goddesses. There is no definate proof to their claims.
ITEM_20151022_007293	The aim of the sacred pact centered around the Tenet Church is the eventual defeat of the Demon Queen. The development of easy to handle weapons that are deadly to demons is only reasonable.
ITEM_20151022_007294	The application of plant regulation effects based on plants on to blunt weapons is even more difficult. It may weaken the weapon before being used on an enemy.
ITEM_20151022_007295	The Lukas Rod is one of the earliest applied examples of magic being used to fight beasts in this region.
ITEM_20151022_007296	Weapons made from weaker materials must be empowered with stronger magic as many Mutant-type monsters are relatively robust.
ITEM_20151022_007297	Insect monsters before Medzio Diena were few and less ferocious. Those were the good old days where a mage could make do with a simple magically enhanced weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007298	The people who support the Ruklys origin theory of this weapon say that Ruklys created them in order to give them to his diverse followers. The people that oppose the theory say that although Ruklys is indeed a talented warrior, he lacks the broad experience needed create different weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007299	Demons were the largest obstacle for pilgrims even before Medzio Diena. These weapons had become a dependable method of defense for pilgrims that could not afford bodyguards.
ITEM_20151022_007300	The opinion that Istora weapons are linked to divine power originating from the goddesses instead of magic or natural power is refuted by the fact that the weapon demonstrates its abilities against Mutant-type monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007301	The bowcrafters were once proud that their bow was created in an independent way and had nothing to do with the Astral Tower.
ITEM_20151022_007302	To craft this bow requires the effort of waiting for the moment a fern blooms at a special time in a place nobody can see. As a matter of fact, all magic that changes the life of a fern into death has roots in such custom rituals.
ITEM_20151022_007303	According to some, this weapon reacts to the unique scents of animals.
ITEM_20151022_007304	Projectile weapons must be crafted so the body itself becomes the magic source and continuously transfers energy and makes it so that the user does not need to be involved directly in the process. It is better if the weapon can recover magic on it's own instead of having to put in ample amounts of magic.
ITEM_20151022_007305	According to some, Agailla Flurry said that even Demon Lord Diena would have been easily defeated if this bow had been in the hands of Lydia Schaffen. Of course it would not be completely ineffective even in the hands of someone else.
ITEM_20151022_007306	Some say that the reason there is no record of Lydia Schaffen evaluating this bow is because the bow and the recipe did not exist at the time. They say that it is unlikely that, given her personality, there would not be any criticism if the recipe existed during Ruklys. Therefore, they argue that all of these Krag items are later designs.
ITEM_20151022_007307	Even weapons as light as bows can deal enormous amounts of damage to Mutant-type monsters. If they are Istora weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007308	The Tenet Crossbow is the most recently designed and produced weapon by the Tenet Church members.
ITEM_20151022_007309	Before Medzio Diena, the ritual of watching the ferns blooming was thought to been for fulfilling wishes or good luck, but all aspects of human life have completely changed since then.
ITEM_20151022_007310	This weapon reacts to the slightest movement of the target after hitting it. However, only the finest movement is required making the delay almost non-exinstant.
ITEM_20151022_007311	Not all Philis weaponry was crafted based on the same magic. In this case, the projectile damages the cause behind the mutation instead of containing magic harmful to the monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007312	Scholars must receive some credit for the resurgence of Flurry's recipe after Medzio Diena. Their tireless exploration and the advancements in epigraphy were some of the reasons the recipe was revitalized and how the weapon could be realized at an opportune moment.
ITEM_20151022_007313	The Krag Crossbow is mainly thought to have appeared in Lydia Schaffen's latter years thanks to her records. However, some say that it had existed before that time but had not been mentioned by her.
ITEM_20151022_007314	The Pilgrim Crossbow was the weapon of choice for pilgrims that were better off. It is only human nature to want to be able to attack from further and more easily than you can with a magic rod.
ITEM_20151022_007315	The Istora region was once famous as a retirement place for scholars and thanks to their intercourse, saw many discoveries and inventions that are still being improved to this day. In the case of the Istora crossbow, that improvement happened after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007316	The Tenet Mace is the base of all weaponry related to the Tenet Church. It existed since the first Paladin and is the first weapon which was infused with magic that would later be used on other weapons.
ITEM_20151022_007317	Some say that the goddesses had hidden mysterious powers in ferns long ago, and think that is why fern observing rituals before Medzio Diena and applying power to weapons after Medzio Diena is possible. No in depth research has been done by theologians or priests despite the ritual being ancient.
ITEM_20151022_007318	Wild animals are frequently encountered enemies for novices and pilgrims. They must be tamed by magic if they cannot be swayed by the goddesses.
ITEM_20151022_007319	Some priests think that weapons used against Mutant-type monsters should be crafted with diverse materials. The complicated process of metal reinforcement, filling it with divine energy and infusion of magic are applied simultaneously to this weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007320	Recipes for maces have been passed through time without being lost. The main reason behind this is because there is a strong atmosphere considering anything related to the legends Maven amongst priests. Thanks to that atmosphere, there were records of Flurry's recipe allowing it to utilized.
ITEM_20151022_007321	Some believe the weapon has the power to break boulders because of the name.
ITEM_20151022_007322	It is the weapon of choice for priests when starting a pilgrimage. Whatever the reason may be, there is a definate tendency amongst priests to be comfortable with and prefer maces.
ITEM_20151022_007323	Opinions are emerging saying that scholars should also help resolve the catastrophies Medzio Diena brought as artifacts such as the Istora Mace are being brought back into the light.
ITEM_20151022_007324	It is difficult to infuse magic to separable weaponry. It is also hard for ordinary people to figure out if the magic used to fight demons is infused in the shaft or head of spears.
ITEM_20151022_007325	The magic symbol Koru is hidden on this spear in the form of a fern sprout. Sprouts have long been symbols of great religious import.
ITEM_20151022_007326	It is inadvisable to use this weapon for hunting even though it may cause greater damage to beasts. It has always been safer to rely on traps and snares when hunting.
ITEM_20151022_007327	It is said that masters of this weapon can remove it from monsters after throwing it from a great distance and attack with it again. Some however point out that this combat style is inefficient.
ITEM_20151022_007328	Unfortunately, parts of the Escanciu Spear recipe have been lost. However, substituting the unknown ingredients with others based on different weapons still created the desired effects. The only problem is that it is unkown if they are the ingredients that Flurry first thought of.
ITEM_20151022_007329	There is no doubt that this weapon is a great help in hunting monsters no matter the circumstances that caused the creator to hide behind the name Krag.
ITEM_20151022_007330	Wild animals are as much of an obstacle to pilgrims as demons. The spear used to be chosen as it is effective against both enemies, requires less care than projectile weapons and can also be used as a cane.
ITEM_20151022_007331	According to some theories, the Istora Spear had an original form unlike different Istora weapons which became the roots on which other Istora weaponry was invented.
ITEM_20151022_007332	It was crafted with the durability to withstand charging Mutant-type monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007333	Insectoid monsters occasionally attack from the air. Therefore, users of this weapon must prepare against air attacks from insectoid monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007334	The largest weakness of theory that Krag weapons were crafted by Ruklys is that it cannot explain the fact that the weapon would not be named as such if it had been crafted prior to the betrayal, and that there would not have been enough time to craft it afterwards.
ITEM_20151022_007335	A weapon that clearly shows that pilgrams truly come from all walks of life. Those that are not afraid of becoming burdens may opt to choose this weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007336	The Istora Pike is said to be the first Istora weapon to be crafted from methods discovered from the Istora Spear.
ITEM_20151022_007337	Weapons based on the Tenet Church were not all conceived at the same time. The staff was crafted relatively late when compared to it's simplicity, and was completed when efforts to maintain different ingredients that have different magic retention times succeeded.
ITEM_20151022_007338	Death was already immanent within the rapid growth behind the explosive increase of plants. It draws as near as life force is used for rapid growth and magic gained from ferns has the same effect on plants.
ITEM_20151022_007339	Though it may seem contradictory, the people that assited the most in crafting this weapon to be effective against beasts are people that had professions related to the care of animals.
ITEM_20151022_007340	Infusing magic against Mutant-type monsters is more difficult than one may think. It must repress the tendency of objects trying to mutate after Medzio Diena as well as being susceptible to magic as a weapon.
ITEM_20151022_007341	Some theorize that the reason Agailla Flurry thought of crafting a weapon effective against insectoid monsters is because nobody had bothered to do so before her.
ITEM_20151022_007342	Those that support the Ruklys origin theory say that the name was changed as he had been declared as a traitor. However, they cannot explain why the name Krag was chosen.
ITEM_20151022_007343	There are numerous locations in the kingdom which contain legends and stories of the goddesses as they have been with us for a long time. It is only natural for there to be pilgrims traveling to those locations and seek measures to make it a safer journey.
ITEM_20151022_007344	There are some that believe that Mutant-type monsters receive more damage from Istora weapons because they are go against the laws of nature.
ITEM_20151022_007345	 - All Cryomancer skills level +2{nl}  - 15% chance to inflict [Freeze] on an enemy for 3 seconds when attacking with an Ice property skill
ITEM_20151022_007346	Training Revolver
ITEM_20151022_007347	Thanks to the resurgence in Istora weaponry, some scholars in the Istora region have invented radically new weapons. This weapon is a representative sample.
ITEM_20151022_007348	Epee
ITEM_20151022_007349	Training Rapier
ITEM_20151022_007350	Aston Rapier

ITEM_20151022_007353	 - All Fencer skills level +1
ITEM_20151022_007354	Venier
ITEM_20151022_007355	- All Fencer skills level +2{nl} - 3% chance of inflicting additional Holy property damage
ITEM_20151022_007356	Long ago, a goddess suggested the crafting of objects to the other goddesses. Most of the goddesses that heeded their colleague's suggestion mainly did so out of amusement, but the goddess that suggested it meant to leave the objects containing the divine powers of the goddesses in the world for the generations to come. One of those arrangements are these gloves
ITEM_20151022_007357	A long time ago, several goddesses made objects containing divine power for their own amusement. It is said that they did so in the Goddess' Ancient Garden but it is difficult to know if this is true. Whatever the case may be, the objects crafted at the time, such as these boots, are still proving their worth.
ITEM_20151022_007358	The fact that the authority of the goddesses is indirectly being used against enemies through the objects they crafted carries great significance even if the goddesses did not put their heart and souls into crafting them.
ITEM_20151022_007359	Long ago, when the goddesses crafted mystical objects for their amusement in the Goddess' Ancient Garden, some were crafted by coating existing ones with their divine power. These clothes are such examples.
ITEM_20151022_007360	It is uncertain if whether the Goddess' Ancient Garden where these gloves were crafted indicates the same location as the Goddess' Ancient Garden known today. Whatever the location may be, the gloves were certainly made in the Goddess' Ancient Garden.
ITEM_20151022_007361	The fact that there are no separate recipes for Ogva equipment is indirect proof that indicates that the origins lie with the goddesses.
ITEM_20151022_007362	Of the many theories, the theory that Laima was the first goddess to propose the crafting of Ogva equipment to the goddesses is the most convincing.
ITEM_20151022_007363	It is unknown if the Goddess' Ancient Garden in which Ogva equipment was said to have been crafted indicates the same location that is known today or how long ago the events took place. However, it is widely believed that it took place before written history.
ITEM_20151022_007364	Some believe that there is an all powerful piece of equipment that contains extreme amounts of divine power based on the fact that Ogva equipment is completed by the goddesses' divine power and spend their lives trying to find it. Of course, all such efforts resulted in failure and it is unknown if there actually is such a piece of equipment. However, those searches did result in the discovery of previously unknown equipment such as these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007365	We cannot know which powers were given to the various pieces of equipment by certain goddesses long ago in the Goddess' Ancient Garden. However, we can make assumptions. These boots most likely have the divine power of Zemyna.
ITEM_20151022_007366	Some complain that the goddesses should have given this piece of equipment better durability and strength when compared to others.
ITEM_20151022_007367	It is unknown how Ogva equipment were spread and revealed to the world. However, too much time has passed to find those origins.
ITEM_20151022_007368	There have been attempts to control plants with other plants since Medzio Diena. These pieces of equipment are one of the successfully applied cases of those attempts.
ITEM_20151022_007369	It is a difficult task to magically apply the self protection substances of ferns to weapons after Medzio Diena. The goddesses must be thanked for the fact that those efforts succeeded.
ITEM_20151022_007370	There are two methods in crafting magical equipment. One is to follow the recipe from the beginning and the other is to infuse pre-existing equipment. It is the latter in the case of this piece of equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007371	It was relatively easy to apply the magic derived from ferns that saw explosive growth after Medzio Diena to offensive equipment. There are cases where the effects changed or weakened in the case of protective equipment such as in the case of this outfit.
ITEM_20151022_007372	The effort of waiting for the moment a fern blooms in a special place where noone can see is required to craft these gloves. The patience and concentration is rewarded by the gloves enhancing the accuracy of the wearer.
ITEM_20151022_007373	The ritual of watching a fern bloom before Medzio Diena was thought to be a custom for wish fulfillment or good luck, but just like all life has changed afterwards, is now a method of applying magic to protective equipment such as this.
ITEM_20151022_007374	Some are of the belief that the fern observing rituals and the reason that power can be applied to equipment after Medzio Diena is because the goddesses hid mystical powers in ferns long ago. No in depth research has been done by theologians or priests despite the ritual being ancient.
ITEM_20151022_007375	The magic symbol Koru is hidden on this outift in the form of a fern sprout. Sprouts have long been symbols of great religious import.
ITEM_20151022_007376	The individual rings that comprise these gloves have been crafted through the application of magical powers symbolized by fern buds. Magical equipment with this sort of power may not be craftable if the vegetation abnormality disappears one day.
ITEM_20151022_007377	All vegetation that saw explosive growth after Medzio Diena possess some degree of life and energy absorption. To apply this ability to equipment and allow it to absorb energy from the earth is a very difficult task.
ITEM_20151022_007378	Magic extracted from ferns can be made to possess either light seeking or shunning characteristics. However, it is made to resist darkness even if it is theoretically possible to make it resist light due to cost and practicality reasons.
ITEM_20151022_007379	There was a time when Divdirbys master Tesla used to roam the kingdom. Some pieces of magic equipment have tales of his travels. People usually accept such legends even though it is uncertain how the sculptor priest Tesla influenced the crafting of these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007380	There is a legend of Tesla crafting these boots after being pricked by a thorn in the foot whilst passing Sirdgela Forest. Whether the forest was filled with thorns or if Tesla really crafted the boots after such an experience is not important. Nobody has gone to ask Tesla even though he is alive and well.
ITEM_20151022_007381	Sirdgela equipment is full of legend and story. Some say that these pants were crafted with cloth woven from thread gathered from brambles. There are many people that are fond of the figure of the lonely girl who makes thread from brambles regardless of whether those tales are true or not.
ITEM_20151022_007382	Those that like to seek the stories related to magical items say that these robes were crafted when Tesla decided become a priest as well as an ordinary sculptor. The psychology of people whom like to attach mystical stories to Sirdgela equipment is a field worth researching.
ITEM_20151022_007383	The reason Sirdgela equipment has more diverse and mystical stories than other magical equipment may be influenced by the unique environment of being a Thorn Forest. However, if that is the case, it means that all the stories are from after Medzio Diena making them works of fiction.
ITEM_20151022_007384	According to legend, there were many soldiers going missing in or near Sirdgela, and these boots were crafted by the families and friends looking for their lost ones.
ITEM_20151022_007385	Developments in the use of leather gained from wild animals that have always infested Sirdgela Forest are said to have been the origins behind this outfit.
ITEM_20151022_007386	It is said that many wild animals existed in Sirdgela even before the increase of monsters after Medzio Diena. These gloves are said to have existed since then.
ITEM_20151022_007387	Although this is only one of the many theories that surrounds Sirdgela equipment, it is said that these boots have been traditionally crafted in the Sirdgela region to traverse rough terrain.
ITEM_20151022_007388	It becomes evidence of an item being crafted long ago in a different environment if magical properties that are unrelated to the weather of a location is infused with equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007389	Philis Gloves are said to have had more magic before Medzio Diena. The reasons behind the weakening of magic after the collapse of the 3 layer castle wall on Medzio Diena remains unknown.
ITEM_20151022_007390	Philis equipment is characterized by it's ability to provide it's wearers with pleasantness in closed environments.
ITEM_20151022_007391	This equipment, which used to be the full-dress uniform of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall, had special magical treatment for reasons only known by the leading members of the army. However, it seems that those reasons will be difficult to figure out as all the high ranking officers are dead.
ITEM_20151022_007392	The regulation issued uniforms of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall were produced in various forms according to their needs. These gloves were produced with ordinary siege warfare in mind.
ITEM_20151022_007393	The regulation issued uniforms of the guards of the 3 layer castle wall were produced in various forms according to their needs. These boots were produced with ordinary siege warfare in mind.
ITEM_20151022_007394	Unlike other pieces of Philis equipment, this piece did not exist before Medzio Diena. It was recently infused with magical properties out of necessity.
ITEM_20151022_007395	It was only issued to the outer wall guards during the early years of the kingdom. It was thought to be useful under the assumption that the outer wall was taken. It was later issued to all 3 walls as tactics and weapons of siege warfare changed.
ITEM_20151022_007396	It is the most useful equipment with magical properties not only all castle guards including those on the 3 layers. It has existed as a favorite of many guards for a long time.
ITEM_20151022_007397	This was equipment issued to guards, especially those that were in charge of attacking with fire on the 3 layer castle wall. An interesting theory that is brought up even now is that those guards may have been able to stop the catastrophic growth of vegetation from the capital which is now in ruins.
ITEM_20151022_007398	Although it is a strange phenomenon, the activities of mages and production of magical items is relatively active in the Allerno Barony when compared to other fiefs. This phenomena has increased dramatically after Medzio Diena and these gloves have appeared in such circumstances.
ITEM_20151022_007399	The increase in magical items in the Allerno barony is hard to explain especially when it has always been an agricultural region. Whatever the reason may be, the people fighting in the region can attribute these boots to that phenomenon.
ITEM_20151022_007400	At first glance, it may not seem strange that there are many magical items such as this outfit because there has been an influx of mages to the Allerno barony. However, this is not the truth and the increase in magical items and new inventions are being caused by something else.
ITEM_20151022_007401	Some mages tried to find if whether the new appearances of magical items in the Allerno region is due to demons but failed to do so. Items that resist darkness such as this are proof that the theory is unlikely.
ITEM_20151022_007402	Whatever the reason behind the sudden appearance of items may be, they are actively gathering and issuing such items to men in Allerno barony. This may be the reason behind mounting conflicts between the residents and soldiers in the region.
ITEM_20151022_007403	It is certain that the Allerno region is being magically influenced from the outside. Although it may not be an impressive amount, the fact still stands that these boots regardless of their performance show new methods of magic infusion.
ITEM_20151022_007404	Another strange point about the magical items that have appeared in the Allerno region is that the mages that come here do not seek them. The items that are discovered are being used by residents or soldiers.
ITEM_20151022_007405	The current lord of Allerno has hired mages and craftsmen in order to further enhance the equipment that already has strong defensive powers. It is said that such moves are hiding other reasons.
ITEM_20151022_007406	If the lord of Allerno did not simply hire the mages and craftsmen to enhance the magical equipment, there is a chance that his goal may be connected to why such items are suddenly appearing.
ITEM_20151022_007407	The lord of Allerno wishes that rarer and stronger magical items will be discovered in his lands. While greed is also behind such thinking, it is also difficult to reproduce the items that have been discovered.
ITEM_20151022_007408	The lord of Allerno is trying to wear this equipment after enhancing it. It is said that he hired mages and craftsmen for this very reason.
ITEM_20151022_007409	There are cases of divine power residing in items that had been carried by priests for a long time. Perelin gloves were crafted as a successful result of trying to have these happenings occur reliably when needed.
ITEM_20151022_007410	There are cases in which the divine power of goddesses indwells and shows new powers in trivial items that poor pilgrims were carrying on their pilgrimage. Equipment with the name Perelin are such items.
ITEM_20151022_007411	It cannot be known what type of protection is indwelling in which pilgrim's items. However, there is some regularity even though generalities have not been discovered. Otherwise, these items would not be able to have the name Perelin.
ITEM_20151022_007412	Many different kinds of experiments are enacted in order to craft Perelin items. The most widely known experiment was to have the pilgrims wear the equipment until divine power resides in it. The results indicate that this does not increase the chance of divine power indwelling in the equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007413	There are increased chances of items becoming Perelin items in the case of making pilgrims perform various tasks whilst wearing the equipment such as these gloves. However, it cannot be seen as a precise recipe as the exact moment that they receive divine power is unknown.
ITEM_20151022_007414	The effects of Perelin items do not disappear even if given to other people after realizing that they have become Perelin items during the pilgrimage. There is no firm principle behind the creation of Perelin items even though pilgrims that have had a piece of equipment turn into Perelin items before usually are able to have more.
ITEM_20151022_007415	Inquiries of whether pilgrims living pious lives makes the authority of goddesses reside in items and whether the creation of items with even more profound abilities is possible is still ongoing. It is only natural if taking the tough living conditions after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007416	It is unknown why such phenomena occurs to pilgrims instead of pious priests that stay in one place. It is made even more unclear by the fact that there are certain cases proving otherwise. The most simple answer is that everything is done in the will of the goddesses.
ITEM_20151022_007417	Although it may seem obvious, these Perelin gloves appear frequently on Paladins.
ITEM_20151022_007418	Perelin items do not always appear on priests. There are numerous cases in which Perelin gloves have appeared on warrior type believers.
ITEM_20151022_007419	The principle behind the natural appearance of Perelin items may never be realized. However, people keep trying to find it thanks to the divine protection that they provide.
ITEM_20151022_007420	According to legend, the first person to obtain Perelin equipment was the first Paladin master. However, it is unclear if this is the truth as the Tenet Church refuses to verify such trivial stories.
ITEM_20151022_007421	Many mages have crafted numerous magical items in the mage tower since Agailla Flurry's death. Most of the creators are anonymous despite several of the items still being used to this day. These are designated as Turn equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007422	Turn equipment have nothing more in common than the fact that they have their origins in the Mage tower. They are simply named as such due to the need to indicate equipment from the tower after Flurry.
ITEM_20151022_007423	Some Turn equipment is suspected to have been made by the same mage due to the similarities in their effects. As in the Turn pants and the Turn robe. But the possibility that they may have been crafted by different mages of different times can't be ruled out.
ITEM_20151022_007424	There was a time when the mages of the Mage Tower after Flurry's death isolated themselves from the world and focused on their experiments and research. Although there were many whimsical inventions during that time, the only partially practical inventions that remain are these Turn gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007425	According to some, Turn equipment may have had better power in the beginning. However, there are no remaining items or recipes due to the reclusive nature of mages. Most of the equipment left has about the same amount of magic as these boots.
ITEM_20151022_007426	There are several cases where they were created out of necessity of mages. It is said that Turn leather pants were created on the spot to protect mages when conducting experiments with lightning.
ITEM_20151022_007427	There are several cases where they were created out of necessity of mages. It is said that Turn leather tunics were created on the spot to protect mages when conducting experiments with lightning.
ITEM_20151022_007428	Some Turn equipment has been reinforced or applied in various ways while being used outside of the Mage Tower. The first known case of such enhancements are these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007429	There was a time where metallic equipment was not crafted because of the many experiments conducted by mages after Flurry's death. Therefore, the existing metallic Turn equipment may have originated from mages but have been completed by anonymous contributors outside of the Mage Tower.
ITEM_20151022_007430	Unlike other metallic Turn equipment, Turn plate leggings are being crafted by mages. It is said that they were used when mages were attempting to fly.
ITEM_20151022_007431	Metallic equipment was not made for centuries after Flurry's death because there was a shortage of metals thanks to the many experiments conducted by mages. As such, even though the existing metallic Turn equipment may have originated from mages, the actual craftsmen are anonymous people from outside the Mage Tower.
ITEM_20151022_007432	The Druid Master from Shaton and tried to make the region safer after Medzio Diena by providing or helping the crafting of equipment. There are cases in which non-combatant farmers have received help from these gloves.
ITEM_20151022_007433	The Druid Master is sending several of her disciples to Shaton to perform various tasks not only out of the love of her hometown but also becuase it is related to her Nature Restoration Plan. The local residents are imitating a few of the simple magic equipment that are used to keep the disciples safe.
ITEM_20151022_007434	The Druid Master does not put restrictions on the Shaton locals imitating the magical equipment that she provided. Therefore, some are being used by people from neighboring regions or explorers, such as these pants.
ITEM_20151022_007435	People being harassed by monsters after Medzio Diena require easily obtainable magical equipment. However, such support is not easy to receive due to several complications. The situation is bad enough that sometimes soldiers fighting monsters on the front lines are not able to obtain equipment they need. The fact that the Druid Master is using her power and resources for the Shaton region is a small but noble act.
ITEM_20151022_007436	Shaton equipment provides diverse amenities for the livelihood of the locals even if they do not fight monsters. Even farmers and lumberjacks need to be accurate.
ITEM_20151022_007437	Some settlers from the Shaton region have disappeared with the equipment. It is unclear if they made a run for it after obtaining equipment or have fallen victim to monsters. Both are equally as likely to have happened. The fact that many of those that have disappeared are people that have obtained boots suggests a certain possibility.
ITEM_20151022_007438	The percentage of settlers in the Shaton region being burned while working has decreased dramatically after this outfit has been issued.
ITEM_20151022_007439	The Druid Master also freely gave help to the nobles of the Shaton region. As a result, the nobility of Shaton was able to increase their survivability when combating monsters.
ITEM_20151022_007440	Some express their concerns that the way the Druid Master unconditionally gave magical items to the Shaton nobility might have been a bad idea. They argue that metallic equipment such as these leggings need not have been provided. In the end however, what is more important is whether the people using the equipment do so with good or bad intentions.
ITEM_20151022_007441	There are some of the belief that it is more important that people are protected from monsters even if they are abusing the Druid Master's goodwill. Such people praise the Druid Master for providing metallic armor.
ITEM_20151022_007442	Many people have found various means to donate to the Tyla Monastery which is a historic religious facility. Those donations became the foundations to the emergence to magical equipment unique to the Tyla Monastery.
ITEM_20151022_007443	Some of the Tyla Monastery equipment was improved with the consent of the original donor. Many people could receive the benefits of such equipment because the Tyla Monastery does not monopolize these items.
ITEM_20151022_007444	The equipment made by the wealth and magical equipment donated to the Tyla Monastery helped people greatly when the surrounding region became a thorn forest. Of course the people that benefited the most were the monks of the Monastery.
ITEM_20151022_007445	The reason why the Tyla Monastery receives particularly more contributions and donations is because it has historically been more lenient towards rulebreakers. The Tyla Monastery has treated sinners and lawbreakers alike gently focusing on reformation instead of punishment in accordance to the Monastery's traditions.
ITEM_20151022_007446	Tyla Monastery has been able to play it's role as a strict self-sufficient religious belief community for priests for a long time without losing sight of the original ideals thanks to it's principles of being strict towards monks and tolerant of outsiders. As such, some magical equipment here has been used in everyday life instead of combat as can be similarly observed in other regions. This is the representative example of such equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007447	Meeting goddesses before Medzio Diena was not uncommon. Even so, criminals who were shameful of their past deeds wished the Tyla Monastery would be a window between themselves and the goddesses and the many that were reformed donated to the Monastery providing the foundations of current Tyla Monastery equipment.
ITEM_20151022_007448	Even equipment that may have been thought to be useless due to the climate of Tyla Monastery became useful after Medzio Diena. This piece of equipment is such a case.
ITEM_20151022_007449	Even the royal family is on the donator list of Tyla Monastery. Many people can wear good metallic equipment thanks to the fact that the Monastery does not hesitate even in distributing royal gifts if useful to the people.
ITEM_20151022_007450	Tyla Monastery was generous in the distribution of all magical equipment they deem can be useful to the people since the royal family did not attach any strings when gifting equipment to the monastery. That is how many people have benefited from these boots.
ITEM_20151022_007451	This piece of equipment has become much more important after the expansive growth of the Thorn Forest near the Tyla Monastery after Medzio Diena.
ITEM_20151022_007452	It is said that this equipment used to have different magical properties. They say that different magical properties were infused after Medzio Diena because of the expansive growth of the Thorn Forest.

ITEM_20160224_010201	Pumpleflap's Robust Horn
ITEM_20160310_010202	Lolopanthers are beings who once served Goddess Zemyna. Although most of them are human, not all of them are.
ITEM_20160310_010203	Not many records remain of those who served Goddess Zemyna in their times. But we can witness sections of the goddess' history through names such as those of a few historical places; and especially the names of weapons such as this.
ITEM_20160310_010204	In light of this situation where the only way left to meet Goddess Zemyna was to climb up the Earth Tower, it'll allow us to restore old history from the names remaining in the tower. We are also left with more opportunities to obtain some pretty powerful magical weapons.
ITEM_20160310_010205	The cost to maintain this bow is pricey, except for those who serve the Fletcher Master. People like Lydia Schaffen, the one who founded the Astral Tower.
ITEM_20160310_010206	The Quarrel Shooter Master himself had received this bow recently.
ITEM_20160310_010207	Some records go as far as calling it a small siege weapon.
ITEM_20160310_010208	 - Causes an explosion after every 10th consecutive attack.
ITEM_20160310_010209	Ores and products of the earth can transform into a powerful weapon with the connivance of the goddess.
ITEM_20160310_010210	This truly makes you proud to be under the protection of the goddess of the earth.
ITEM_20160310_010211	Some people believe that Lolopanther equipment is made without the permission of the goddess, and is simply taking advantage of her absence.
ITEM_20160310_010212	Others believe Goddess Zemyna bestowed the right to freely use any material that grows on her land. If that wasn't the case, it would be impossible to mine the materials. However, this does not mean that we have the absolute right to do what we want.
ITEM_20160310_010213	The history of the Lolopanthers is surprisingly long. Unlike other weapons, the Lolopanther Dagger dates back to before the kingdom was founded.
ITEM_20160310_010214	One legend told that Goddess Zemyna's temple itself was a pillar of the earth. The legend is now forgotten, but the staff celebrating the legend remains to this day.
ITEM_20160310_010215	Warsis Creak has succeeded in developing a new type of weapon from the Lolopanther Musket. However, it is unknown when and how this happened.
ITEM_20160310_010216	A weapon as firm as the ground, light as a feather, and strong as a rock.
ITEM_20160310_010217	The masters who deal with gunpowder regularly use it with newly designed or discovered weapons. The same can be said for this cannon. Quicktongue, however, hardly shares any new discoveries and is likely considering his military career.
ITEM_20160310_010218	Those who dare to belittle the weapons grown by the goddess are doomed to have their blood fed to her earth.
ITEM_20160310_010219	Those who worship the great goddess will receive the wisdom through one's humility. This equipment proves that this is true not only for clerics, but for wizards too.
ITEM_20160310_010220	Whoever carries this will become the master of the earth and receive its grace with every step. However, maintaining this equipment is a problem for humans in regard to cost, which is of no concern to the goddess.
ITEM_20160310_010221	Regardless of what rights the goddess of the earth may give, those who carry and use this equipment do so to their own abilities. Do you not wonder whether it possesses an even greater power?
ITEM_20160310_010222	With every new piece of equipment, the power bestowed by the goddess of the earth is imparted on it.
ITEM_20160310_010223	Users of this equipment may not realize, but designers and artisans know that obtaining the blessing of Goddess Zemyna when using leather is not as easy as it is for cloth or metal. Thanks to their effort, it shines today on the battlefield.
ITEM_20160310_010224	Compared to other leather equipment, it is more readily blessed by Goddess Zemyna since it comes into direct contact with the ground.
ITEM_20160310_010225	Some Lolopanther equipment was not also made using the power of the owner of the tower, Goddess Zemyna, but also of the invading demons. In this case, it is important to maintain balance for equipment.
ITEM_20160310_010226	Many of the efforts to take away the power of the demons and what they were targeting remains unknown. The answers lay buried in the history of the Earth Tower.
ITEM_20160310_010227	The goddess of the earth is glad to offer humans the ores forged at her hands. However, she does not look kindly on those who take her gifts for granted.
ITEM_20160310_010228	The goddess of the earth may have allowed humans to carry weapons; that does not mean she hopes they will bring war and bloodshed. There is a special reason to make use of this particular piece of equipment.
ITEM_20160310_010229	This piece of equipment helps your two legs stand firm on Goddess Zemyna's territory.
ITEM_20160310_010230	Your faith in Goddess Zemyna and your courage need to stand forever - as firm as the earth. You must stay resolute if you receive this equipment.
ITEM_20160310_010231	The grace of the goddess of the earth is in your heart; the time to show the world your bravery has come.
ITEM_20160310_010232	It is possible to focus the power of all the goddesses in an object to increase one's abilities. It is said that the first person to ever succeed in this type of magic infusion was a nun from Saalus Convent.
ITEM_20160310_010233	Among the efforts to combine holy and magic power while eliminating conflicting elements, a few objects were made that were both a success and a failure. This bracelet is an example of such paradoxical creations.
ITEM_20160310_010234	This piece of equipment will help you pierce through the demonic darkness.
ITEM_20160310_010235	This bracelet works by strenghtening the war spirit of those who wear it. It is very powerful, but it does not come without some drawbacks.

ITEM_20170912_015498	More than protection, the attire of a gladiator is first and foremost about showmanship. A perfect armor decreases the enjoyment of the audience, which is why the Murmillo's covers only half of the body.

ITEM_20170912_015505	Warlocks may not be the most popular class in the social sphere, but their presence has long been customary at all kinds of gatherings. Because of this, Warlock garments are purposely made to look appropriate for balls and formal parties.

ITEM_20170912_015514	Chaplain clothing combines colors and elements symbolizing the goddesses to convey a sense of security to battling soldiers. Despite this, the philosophy behind Chaplain garments does not allow for their adaptation to real combat situations.
ITEM_20170912_015515	These garments are known to be highly resistant to dirt, allowing them to last for longer periods of time without washing. Not only that, they are designed for easy laundering.
ITEM_20170912_015516	Traditionally, the ornaments in Kabbalist clothing each represent a different academic achievement. However, the lack of enforcement of this custom by the current Kabbalist Master has made it so that even beginners have started to wear the ornaments freely.

ITEM_20171128_015961	Como magia pode resolver vários problemas com facilidade, não havia necessidade de um mecanismo que transferisse forças físicas, feito engrenagens.

Só que, devido a este fato, o efeito mágico desta arma é um tanto quanto forte.

ITEM_20171128_016045	Há um rumor de que vários Wizards que vieram após Masinios riram do fato dele não ser capaz de criar um método de produção incrível para a Besta, onde ele pudesse demonstrar a vantagem do maquinismo. Outro rumor é que Lucid Winterspoon reprimiu tais Wizards, fazendo com que fossem capazes de opinar somente se trabalhassem a teoria da magia ao menos na metade do nível que Masinios fez, além de manterem no mínimo duas posições de Mestre.

ITEM_20171128_016095	Este é o resultado da tentativa de aprimoramento da Maça feita pelo próprio Masinios. Devido ao fato da Maça de 2 Mãos ter uma performance completamente diferente da de 1 Mão, pode-se perceber que essa não era a intenção dele. Em vez disso, pode-se dizer que ele achava que estava tudo bem que esse desempenho fosse resultado de sua tentativa.

ITEM_20171128_016155	Masinios estava tão obcecado pelo futuro do maquinismo que trocou seu nome para Masinios. Por causa disso, o seu nome verdadeiro foi enterrado e esquecido na escuridão da história, nunca mais revelado. Porém, esta Lança é feita com a receita que ele desenvolveu antes dessa troca de nome, portanto seu nome poderia ser localizado através do poder mágico deixado na receita. Como Masinios não é uma pessoa dos tempos antigos tão popular assim, ninguém pensou em realizar este processo.

ITEM_20171128_016287	Há razões conflitantes do por quê Masinios, sendo um Wizard, decidiu se dedicar ao maquinismo, mas uma teoria é de que isso é devido a penúltima Wizard, Agailla Flurry. Dizem que ele foi atraído pelo maquinismo devido a própria criação da Mage Tower por Flurry. É dito que este Florete foi feito durante um período em que Masinios favorecia a magia e considerava o maquinismo somente um hobby.

ITEM_20180517_018259	Velcoffer Helmet
ITEM_20180517_018260	Dragons can be biologically classified by how magic affects them. For one, it's been proven that dragons belong in the same broad category as Beast type monsters, due to how similarly they react to specific types of magic.

ITEM_20180517_018263	Velcoffer Sword
ITEM_20180517_018264	Dragons have been known to store the divine vital force they find spread throughout the world in their bodies, in the hopes of gathering the power to defy future goddesses. That vital force, however, can also be used by humans to produce weapons. An example of that is Teliavelis' gear series, where the designs take inspiration from dragons. 
ITEM_20180517_018265	Velcoffer Two-handed Sword
ITEM_20180517_018266	Some speculate that goddesses like Austeja are for the preservation of dragons as a means to provide some kind of security for humans in the future. Teliavelis, on the other hand, believes that it is simply a proof of the goddesses' respect for all living creatures.
ITEM_20180517_018267	Velcoffer Rod
ITEM_20180517_018268	It is said that those who are spiritually sensitive can discern the energy of both goddesses and dragons in this weapon. The combination of such contrasting powers remains forever unfamiliar to those who experience it.
ITEM_20180517_018269	Velcoffer Bow
ITEM_20180517_018270	Many artisans believe they can produce Velcoffer equipment from regular materials. However, Teliavelis has shown that it takes a talented blacksmith to be able to handle materials containing the power of the goddesses.
ITEM_20180517_018271	 - Increases all Quarrel Shooter skill levels by {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2{nl} - Increases skill level of Running Shot by {img green_up_arrow 16 16}1

ITEM_20180517_018274	Velcoffer Crossbow
ITEM_20180517_018275	This weapon is produced with real dragon scales, although one knows for sure how Teliavelis obtains them.
ITEM_20180517_018276	Velcoffer Mace
ITEM_20180517_018277	Teliavelis is the only blacksmith known to have mastered the technique required to quickly solidify metal components. Some believe he uses the intense cooling properties of dragons when casting the metal.
ITEM_20180517_018278	Velcoffer Two-handed Mace
ITEM_20180517_018279	Although its handle is made of metal, this weapon produces no unwanted vibration when hitting the target. You could say that it is proof of Teliavelis' extraordinary talent.
ITEM_20180517_018280	Velcoffer Shield
ITEM_20180517_018281	According to a recently uncovered Exorcist report, after its design was initially revealed, this shield caught the attention of several high-ranking demons. Realistically, of course, it is highly unlikely that any of them will ever possess one. 
ITEM_20180517_018282	Velcoffer Spear
ITEM_20180517_018283	Some artisans and wizards suspect that Teliavelis may have gotten the Velcoffer Spear and Pike designs confused when crafting this weapon. The difference is merely visual, however, as it doesn't affect the weapons' performance.
ITEM_20180517_018284	 - Deals {img green_up_arrow 16 16}235 additional damage when using [Impaler]
ITEM_20180517_018285	Velcoffer Pike
ITEM_20180517_018286	The ornaments may resemble a pair of wings, but this weapon is not intended to be thrown over long distances.
ITEM_20180517_018287	Velcoffer Dagger
ITEM_20180517_018288	Some believe that the blade is made not from metal, but dragon bone. Unfortunately, dragon bones are a rare material, making this claim almost impossible to confirm.
ITEM_20180517_018289	 - 20% chance of dealing additional Fire property damage equal to 33% of your character level for 10 sec when using Hell Breath.
ITEM_20180517_018290	Velcoffer Staff

ITEM_20180517_018294	Velcoffer Rapier
ITEM_20180517_018295	Despite its design, this sword provides decent protection to both hands and wrists. Some users, however, say that holding it can feel like touching the inside of a dragon's mouth.
ITEM_20180517_018296	Velcoffer Cannon
ITEM_20180517_018297	Recently, the Cannoneer Master has announced her opposition to the use of this weapon for military purposes. She firmly believes that the Royal Army should not mass-produce rare weapons like this one. 
ITEM_20180517_018298	 - [Covering Fire] skill level {img green_up_arrow 16 16} 1
ITEM_20180517_018299	Velcoffer Musket
ITEM_20180517_018300	Experts who have used this weapon tend to have a good impression of it. Its only flaw, they say, is that it can be hard to clean without getting injured. Fortunately, at least, it doesn't seem to backfire any sparks when used.
ITEM_20180517_018301	Velcoffer Robe
ITEM_20180517_018302	Surprisingly, the Velcoffer Robe is the most difficult piece to produce out of the entire Velcoffer gear series. This is because the robe is made from very delicate materials.
ITEM_20180517_018303	Velcoffer Leather Armor
ITEM_20180517_018304	Many believe, mistakenly, that Velcoffer equipment is made with dragon leather. While it is true that Teliavelis uses dragon materials in his gear, this piece does not include any dragon leather components.
ITEM_20180517_018305	Velcoffer Plate Armor
ITEM_20180517_018306	One legend says that Froster Lord used the power of Giltine to freeze over the world of the dragons a long time ago. Such strong magic can only be undone if Giltine herself allows her powers to be used again. 
ITEM_20180517_018307	Velcoffer Pants
ITEM_20180517_018308	Some say that Teliavelis has several ideas ready for future gear series, ideas no one has ever thought of before. Apparently, he is just waiting for the right time to reveal them.
ITEM_20180517_018309	Velcoffer Leather Pants
ITEM_20180517_018310	According to Teliavelis, after Medzio Diena the magic used to enhance equipment items has been irreversibly changed. Therefore, in his gear he prefers to focus on the performance, leaving the magic components open to more diverse setups.
ITEM_20180517_018311	Velcoffer Plate Pants
ITEM_20180517_018312	According to legends, the most powerful dragons are still alive in the dragon world. As long as their realm is dominated by the Froster Lord, however, the dragons will remain trapped there, unable to escape. 
ITEM_20180517_018313	Sausis Leather Boots
ITEM_20180517_018314	Although they maintain their traditional style to this day, the original Sausis boots were unimaginably faster.
ITEM_20180517_018315	Velcoffer Boots
ITEM_20180517_018316	One legend says that Velcoffer originally worked as a guard for an even stronger dragon. Whether that was true or not, the dragon he was said to work for is no longer alive.
ITEM_20180517_018317	Velcoffer Leather Boots
ITEM_20180517_018318	A few Class Masters believe that, if Teliavelis was involved in producing equipment for the goddesses, that could constitute proof that he is part of the Amzinas. The other Amzinas, however, have never confirmed whether that is true or simply a rumor.
ITEM_20180517_018319	Velcoffer Greaves
ITEM_20180517_018320	No one knows for sure if there are other dragons besides Boruta and Velcoffer roaming our world, but the possibility is there. Especially after Medzio Diena, these creatures have had more opportunities than ever to escape their confinement.
ITEM_20180517_018321	Velcoffer Gloves
ITEM_20180517_018322	While many consider Teliavelis a great craftsman, some believe that there is something more to his originality. It is thought that his pieces were designed with the wisdom of the goddesses, and that he is merely their maker and conveyer.
ITEM_20180517_018323	Velcoffer Leather Gloves
ITEM_20180517_018324	Sometimes, finished pieces of Velcoffer gear are found in our world. Strangely enough, they don't seem to have been made by humans, which has led magic Class Masters to assume that the goddesses possessed the original versions of Teliavelis' items.
ITEM_20180517_018325	Velcoffer Plate Gauntlets
ITEM_20180517_018326	Legends tell that one powerful dragon named Boruta crossed over to our world a long time ago. They say that, compared to him, Velcoffer is still a relatively young dragon.

ITEM_20180517_018329	Varpas Necklace
ITEM_20180517_018330	Considering that this necklace can drop from defeated demons, one would think that it does not distinguish between the good and bad nature of the wearer. On the other hand, it could also mean that the necklace is likely to betray its lawful owner.
ITEM_20180517_018331	Verijo Necklace
ITEM_20180517_018332	There is a strong possibility that Demon Goddess Ragana is connected to this piece. She is said to belong to a trinity of demon deities.

ITEM_20181017_019685	O Wastrel mesmo não tem interesse em artefatos que retornaram do passado. É a forte magia acumulada no seu corpo que atrai estes artefatos antigos e até conecta eles no monstro.

ITEM_20181017_019695	Asio Rod

ITEM_20181017_019703	O Asiomage dá continuidade na pesquisa para improvisar o equipamento desenvolvido originalmente pelo seu outro eu, o Quipmage. Este item, por exemplo, já é mais efetivo do que quando retornou primeiramente ao nosso mundo.

ITEM_20181017_019713	Wastrel Zvaigzde Two-handed Mace
ITEM_20181017_019714	Alguns dos itens atraídos pela magia corporal do Wastrel são, na verdade, nocivos a ele. Do contrário, o Wastrel seria ainda mais poderoso do que já é.

ITEM_20181017_019724	Wastrel Zvaigzde Spear
ITEM_20181017_019725	Muitos itens que contém gemas mágicas possuem efeitos negativos no corpo do Wastrel. Isto pode ser considerado uma ocorrência afortunada.
ITEM_20181017_019726	Asio Spear
ITEM_20181017_019727	Uma Lança projetada por um Wizard. O Quipmage não parece que considerou que o formato desta arma poderia gerar problemas.

ITEM_20181017_019731	O Asiomage perdeu memórias cruciais sobre a sua linha de equipamentos, ao mesmo tempo que se pergunta o por quê de lembrar de outras informações pouco relevantes. Dizem que é por isso que não há nenhuma versão melhorada da Asio Pike.

ITEM_20181017_019734	Dizem que este item corre pelas veias do Wastrel. Apesar do sangue e do sistema circulatório do monstro serem muito diferentes da maioria dos seres vivos, ainda parece causar dor ao Wastrel quando o item passa por certas regiões do corpo.
ITEM_20181017_019735	Asio Dagger
ITEM_20181017_019736	 - Ataques com Adaga, enquanto estiver escondido, aumentam o dano em 15%

ITEM_20181017_019741	Diferente do Asio Rod, o Asio Staff é famoso por derrubar os espíritos do Asiomage. O ganho de inteligência faz com que ele reviva ainda mais memórias do seu passado turbulento.

ITEM_20181017_019743	 - Nível de [Full Metal Jacket] {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2{nl}  - Nível de [Retreat Shot] {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2
ITEM_20181017_019744	Devido a fenda criada pelo Medzio Diena, o espaço onde fica o Wastrel começou a atrair itens comuns encontrados no presente. Isso significa que o Wastrel não está cercado só de armas como esta Pistola, mas também de uma diversidade de itens, como sapatos gastos e cadeiras quebradas.

ITEM_20181017_019751	 - Nível de [Epee Garde] {img green_up_arrow 16 16}2
ITEM_20181017_019752	Apesar da Pervading Queen ter sido a projetista original desta arma, o Asiomage é quem está atualmente desenvolvendo ela. A Pervading Queen perdeu o interesse, há muito tempo, na produção de equipamentos.

ITEM_20191024_023470	[Evento] Ignas Robe
ITEM_20191024_023471	É difícil dizer quais métodos o Ignas usou para confeccionar este item através da Essência de Ziburynas. Se ele foi capaz de obter o poder completo da Essência, ele certamente teria criado um equipamento muito mais forte.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023472	[Evento] Ignas Leather Armor
ITEM_20191024_023473	Ninguém sabe exatamente o por quê do Ignas produzir diferentes peças de equipamento de materiais tão variados. Alguns acreditam que ele tinha a intenção de avançar contra outros inimigos além da Resistência.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023474	[Evento] Ignas Plate Armor
ITEM_20191024_023475	Considerando que a Astral Tower fica localizada no meio de um lago, as chances de um ataque surpresa são significativamente baixas. Isto leva a imaginar, então, quais as intenções do Ignas por trás da confecção desta armadura de metal.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023476	[Evento] Ignas Pants
ITEM_20191024_023477	Pode-se assumir que Ignas só possuía uma quantidade limitade da Essência de Ziburynas, analisando a pouca quantidade que ele usou na sua linha de equipamentos.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023478	[Evento] Ignas Leather Pants
ITEM_20191024_023479	Se não fosse por restrições na produção, um exército da Schaffenstar equipado com os itens do Ignas se tornaria o mais forte do Reino. Pode-se até argumentar que seria suficiente para derrotar qualquer outra das forças armadas da nação de 4 para 1.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023480	[Evento] Ignas Plate Pants
ITEM_20191024_023481	Quando Ignas desenvolveu estas calças, ele mencionou que foram projetadas como equipamento de teste para os Scharzer Reiters e outros mercenários da Astral Tower.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023482	[Evento] Ignas Boots
ITEM_20191024_023483	A Astral Tower possui diferentes tipos de pavimentação, incluindo pisos de malha de arame. Estas Botas foram criadas para proteger os pés do usuário de qualquer material de piso.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023484	[Evento] Ignas Leather Boots
ITEM_20191024_023485	Dizem que algumas peças contém a inscrição "As Estrelas sob Schaffenstar, Schaffenstar sob o Mundo."{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023486	[Evento] Ignas Greaves
ITEM_20191024_023487	De acordo com os experimentos do Sênior Ramunas, extrair a Essência de Ziburynas do equipamento de Ignas não é tão fácil quando parece. Ele acredita, porém, que um Mestre de Classe mágico pode ser capaz de alcançar isso algum dia.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023488	[Evento] Ignas Gloves
ITEM_20191024_023489	Vendo como cada peça do equipamento de Ignas é adornado com símbolos da Schaffenstar, pode-se assumir que estes seriam os itens utilizados por seus membros, caso ele permanecesse como líder da organização.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023490	[Evento] Ignas Leather Gloves
ITEM_20191024_023491	Conforme relatos do início da carreira, Ignas previu que qualquer ato de traição dentro da Schaffenstar enfrentaria três obstáculos: as provisões de Lydia Schaffen, a Muralha de Três Camadas do Castelo, alem da neutralidade dos Mestres de Classe. Estas luvas, porém, possuem a pista de qual Mestre ele previu como um aliado.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023492	[Evento] Ignas Plate Gauntlets
ITEM_20191024_023493	As garras nestas Luvas são úteis não somente para situações de combate, mas também nas rotinas dos membros da Schaffenstar, especialmente na limpeza das paredes externas da Astral Tower.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023494	Este equipamento em específico desapareceu com o acidente de Nicopolis, mas retornou ao nosso mundo mais ou menos no mesmo momento que o Asiomage e o Quipmage.
ITEM_20191024_023495	O Asiomage é notavelmente apaixonado por esta arma, pois ela garante um aumento de inteligência. Mais do que uma ferramenta, esta arma serve como um tipo de brinquedo que melhora o humor do monstro.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023496	O Quipmage sempre teve interesse em expandir sua influência. Para alcançar isso, fez planos para recrutar mercenários e equipá-los com suas armas, capazes de superar os poderes das que são usadas pelo Exército Real.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023497	O Asiomage dá continuidade na pesquisa para improvisar o equipamento desenvolvido originalmente pelo seu outro eu, o Quipmage. Este item, por exemplo, já é mais efetivo do que quando retornou primeiramente ao nosso mundo.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023498	O Asiomage não gosta desta arma. Ele ainda se lembra de ser usado como alvo vivo em experimentos anteriores, particularmente para Bestas.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023499	Alguns cientistas reclamam que o nome desse item é arbitrário, afinal não possui nenhuma semelhança com corujas.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023500	Dizem que essa arma foi projetada para um exército de monstros Golem. Não se sabe se o Quipmage ou o Asiomage possuem qualquer memória deste fato.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023501	Diferente de outros itens da linha Asio, este aqui representa fielmente o estilo e convenções populares da antiga Nicopolis, antes do grande acidente.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023502	Uma Lança projetada por um Wizard. O Quipmage não parece que considerou que o formato desta arma poderia gerar problemas.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023503	O Asiomage perdeu memórias cruciais sobre a sua linha de equipamentos, ao mesmo tempo que se pergunta o por quê de lembrar de outras informações pouco relevantes. Dizem que é por isso que não há nenhuma versão melhorada da Asio Pike.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023504	O Quipmage planejava usar esta arma para assassinar a Pervading Queen e o Teal Specter. Todos estes três Wizards tinham planos para aniquilar uns aos aoutros, cada um através dos seus próprios meios.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023505	Diferente do Asio Rod, o Asio Staff é famoso por derrubar os espíritos do Asiomage. O ganho de inteligência faz com que ele reviva ainda mais memórias do seu passado turbulento.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023506	O Asiomage possui muito orgulho desta arma. Ele começou a desenvolver as suas próprias armas de fogo após retonar para o nosso mundo.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023507	Apesar da Pervading Queen ter sido a projetista original desta arma, o Asiomage é quem está atualmente desenvolvendo ela. A Pervading Queen perdeu o interesse, há muito tempo, na produção de equipamentos.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023508	O Asiomage foi fortemente influenciado pelo fervor escolar excessivo que é típico dos Wizards, que o levou a criar armas desnecessárias sem uma razão aparente.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023509	Após retornar para o nosso mundo e aprender que várias espécies de aves mutaram em monstros, o Asiomage fez planos para criar o seu próprio exército de pássaros para carregar esta arma. Um pensamento meio avoado, alguém poderia pensar.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023510	O Wastrel mesmo não tem interesse em artefatos que retornaram do passado. É a forte magia acumulada no seu corpo que atrai estes artefatos antigos e até conecta eles no monstro.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023511	Artefatos antigos atraídos pelo Wastrel são conhecidos por interagir com a magia peculiar do monstro. É difícil prever quais novos tipos de magia podem surgir dessas interações.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023512	Há muito tempo atrás, um Wizard criou uma grande chave e uma fechadura, e com isso produziram esta arma. Apesar da aparência, porém, é normalmente utilizada como bengala para caminhar.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.

ITEM_20191024_023515	Alguns Wizards da antiga Nicopolis eram opositores secretos do Reino, mas para fingir apoio, eles desenvolveram algumas armas que faem uso de poderes divinos.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023516	Alguns dos itens atraídos pela magia corporal do Wastrel são, na verdade, nocivos a ele. Do contrário, o Wastrel seria ainda mais poderoso do que já é.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023517	Felizmente para todos, o Wastrel não usa esse escudo para proteção. Porém, dizem que o Escudo alivia as dores de gerar novos itens de equipamentos.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023518	Muitos itens que contém gemas mágicas possuem efeitos negativos no corpo do Wastrel. Isto pode ser considerado uma ocorrência afortunada.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023519	De todos os itens atraídos pelo Wastrel, alguns são incorporados fisicamente, enquanto outros tem somente suas propriedades mágicas absorvidas. Dizem que os objetos fisicamente assimilados cutucam constantemente o corpo do Wastrel.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023520	Dizem que este item corre pelas veias do Wastrel. Apesar do sangue e do sistema circulatório do monstro serem muito diferentes da maioria dos seres vivos, ainda parece causar dor ao Wastrel quando o item passa por certas regiões do corpo.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023521	Nos primeiros dias de existência desta arma, era comum que se quebrasse em três pedaços. Grandes quantidades de magia foram utilizadas para aumentar a sua durabilidade, tanta que, hoje, ela não irá quebrar mesmo que seja fundida dentro do Wastrel.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023522	Devido a fenda criada pelo Medzio Diena, o espaço onde fica o Wastrel começou a atrair itens comuns encontrados no presente. Isso significa que o Wastrel não está cercado só de armas como esta Pistola, mas também de uma diversidade de itens, como sapatos gastos e cadeiras quebradas.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023523	Armas como esta, com baixo poder de corte, podem terminar facilmente presas no corpo do Wastrel. Felizmente para ele, porém, elas não causam nenhuma dor nele.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023524	Vendo como várias armas foram absorvidas para dentro do corpo do Wastrel, alguém poderia pensar que ao menos algumas delas seriam incorporadas dentro dele.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023525	Esta arma não foi absorvida para dentro do corpo do Wastrel, tendo viajado pela fenda que apareceu durante o Medzio Diena. Dizem que foi cuidada por um aventureiro que tentou derrotar o Wastrel.{nl}- Pode ter seu Ichor extraído ou transmutado.
ITEM_20191024_023526	Crescent Moon
ITEM_20191024_023527	Exibe uma lua crescente atrás do personagem.{nl}- Efeito é exibido quando estiver parado.{nl}- Efeito é removido quando entrar em combate.{nl}Pode ser trocado por Medalhas na Loja de Trocas.
